the water was falling drop by drop
the water had started a fire
then my heart was remembering you
beloved now you only tell me
what should i do
without you i can't live anymore
without you what is my existence
then i'll be separated from myself
i live every day for you
if i become yours
because you are the one
now you are the one
you are my life now
both peace and pain my love are now only you
what kind of relationship is ours
i cannot bear a moment without you
i have given you all my time
your name is on every breath i take
thank you for your understanding
if i get separated from you
my love are now only you 
my love are now you only
then i'll be separated from myself
without you i can't live anymore
how beautiful god has made you
how can i assist you
how can i tell her
# from avatar the way of water (2022) websrt
do
pandora's forest
a very dangerous place
but the most dangerous thing
in pandora
to love it more
remember we are singing
every bead
there is a story in our life
a bead for the birth of our child
netiyam
netiyam
a bead
the day we adopted our daughter kiri
birth of grace's avatar
a daughter whose conception was a mystery
a bead
to the day of the first relationship with iva
people say
we live in aiwa
iva lives inside us
queen mother
holding his children
from her heart
happiness is simple
but who would have thought that a fool like me would break the rules  
the day i first met your father
i tried to kill him
it was love at first sight
before i knew it four people had arrived
when we bring the skymen back to earth
a few stopped
the science guys are partial to the navies
then there was spider
he was stuck there
he is too small for the cairocapsule
little mischievous boy
see you noam
orphaned by war
he was adopted by the labmates
spider take the rest
i'm only going to the village
he is not part of our family
he is like a stray cat
always out
cannot be separated from our children
neytiri to
he was always an alien
one of them
he belongs to his nation
it's mine
i took it first
why am i giving you this  
it took a few years to get the language into my head
this is mine
lo'ak liar give me this
but now when i hear
it sounds sinhala to me
i hate you
i hate you endlessly lo'ak
stupid face
hey hey that's enough
don't take me there
he will come out of those looking stones
there he is
that's right go get it
ok
hey neteyam the great fisherman
that's right good boy
wow that's a big one
from stones
just like you said
how tall is he
 he is so tall  he is tall
growing fast
like a dream
 milk  come on bro
come on
smile
happiness is simple
like noon
keep away from children
but talking about happiness
it disappears instantly
a new star in the night
it means only one thing
planes coming down
the sky men are coming again
a year later
heart rate 168
here it comes
you are fine
don't move
calm down
ok eyeglasses work well
get it off your face

pulse 89
if you haven't figured it out yet you are colonel miles quaritch
another young tall blue
not pretty at all
in two hours i'll be on a mission…
against the fortress of the na'vi
a power that is thought to be visionary is doing this with the intention of taking it hastily
if you are watching this
i mean i got my ticket
hey parker
what the hell am i supposed to say now  
remind him how this is done
here
see this   this is your entire memory and your personality
we send this back to earth
to the lab where you are growing as we speak
we'll soak you in this and then…
hey hey hey
if i don't do this or you  
hurry up hurry up
however the idea
to know the heart of those who were in that world
just like corporal waynfleet
and your humble bookkeeper
body adder
you're a communicator again colonel
filled with my memories and thoughts
what you don't remember is my death
because it hasn't happened yet
it won't happen
 okay  damn right
whatever
if you're my clone you'll have something to pay back
jake sully will be at the top of that list

i know you all are asking the same question
why so blue  
for the sins of our past lives
we have been brought back
as our enemies
that gives us their size strength and speed
with our training
it is a great strength for us

the leader of the na'vi rebellion

jake sali

yes i can still lick your ass
it's a great day
very long
really fun friends

you can breathe earth's gas for hours
i can only breathe your gas for about 10 seconds
those baby monkeys that's the end
to you
 hi max  hey kids
hey what's going on max  
what's up nom
hi mom
maybe i'm getting bored here
but i see real evidence
the responses of a network of systems are worldclass
i can't
i don't use the word smart it
perhaps awareness is the right word
it's like the whole pandora biosphere
awareness
and there is potential for this enlightened response
come on i can't say that
they will sacrifice me
i mean i want to say…
who do you think attacked him  
pretty sure it was noam
really
you don't deserve to live
no no no think about it right  
i mean he's the teacher's pet
he was always with her in the lab
i will kill myself
i drink acid
bro you are right he's like every shot
bro look look the way he looks
hey
see i think
their two avatars were alone in the forest
hey
friends
i mean sometimes it's not good to know who your father is
anything
don't even mention him
no spider
 dude  spider
you are not like him
go go go directly to the terminal inside
don't stop
take off the mask
sir
this is the general
general ardmore
nice to meet you colonel
i've heard good things
but you have changed a lot since the last time you came here
come with me
the new operations center is here
just like it was on the internet
these insect collectors they can build a building in six days
we did things last year rather than 30 years ago
we didn't come here to dig a mine colonel
as the commander of the surface world says
i have received a great mission
earth is dying
our aim is to control this border
pandora is the new home for people
nothing less than that
but before we do that
we need to reconcile our enemies
sally's attacks are intense and frequent
his attacks are well planned
he has a good relationship with people on the ground and in the air
his forces are attacking our local positions for mines pipes
reducing our supplies
they attacked the maglev two days ago
do you have any information
about the operations center  
yes show me the mountains
it is a cave system located in the hallelujah mountains
but every time we sent our troops there we were defeated
our machines really seem to have stirred up the wasp's basket
we got 10 minutes in enemy territory
they surrounded us
colonel
we believe your blue team will go tribal…
it will not work
their defensive responses
how do we test that hypothesis general  
the hard way
great
we are entering enemy airspace
ok
 bro  let's go monkey boy
friends wait
tuck stay close
ok ok

in the south
they have a man
a boy who speaks na'vi
did they kill someone  
not yet
they are scared
but the villagers did not tell you where you are
because of my command
we must hunt down this monster
catch up
to kill
we have to be smart
we have to be smart
if we attack quaritch
they know where we are
they come here with everything they can
so what is our plan  
this is toruk makto
head down
did he come here  
this shit doesn't work
not they are deceiving us
if we turn up the heat
he will keep running
let's get him out
i will do
i have work to do
do you want to be bullied  
let's pray
here   not here
there are many villagers here
not no no no
sincerely sir
you don't understand
this is the relationship
navi is between tulkun and the sea
it's like killing a family member
if we start the hunt here
enemies will come from our side
exactly
one enemy
especially
i know how you feel
i feel lonely too
tell me
why are you a bully  
i'm sorry
i am very sorry
no problem
it doesn't matter
you allowed this
you let him connect with chandala
tsyria
you make me sad girl
and you
son of a good hero
well educated
payakan saved my life sir
you don't know him
no lo'ak
sit down
sit down
sit down
listen to my words boy
in the days when i sang the first songs
tulkun fought with us
in our area
take revenge
but they began to believe
by killing no matter how justified
it only brings more deaths
so all deaths were forbidden
this is the tulkun way
payakan
an assassin so
he is a bully
i'm sorry sir
but you are wrong
lo'ak
you're talking to olo'ekton
i know i
that's enough
i know what i know
that's enough
i will take care of him
this storm will subside
lo'ak i saw something today
i saw a wild boy
a tulkun is chosen
i am very proud of you
payakan did not kill those boys
i saw it all
that demon ship killed his mother right in front of his eyes
he gathered the youth and the rock boys together
attack the ship
they all died
by the sky people not from him
 he is not a murderer  no lo'ak
as tulkun he is
he bears those deaths
will he have to pay for it for the rest of his life  
he knows what he did was wrong he won't do it again
we have to tell my father
no no
i am already in trouble with my father
your father will understand this
not
he doesn't understand anything
the whole gang hates me
devil's blood
the alien that's all they see
i see you
you are a tulkun brother
you are one of us now
did you catch my mom
mother and baby a good sign 4000 in a limit
get down
to the ship's deck
coming down
the legs were put on the ground
the submarine team
two minutes
let's go there
close the opening
come on
in a hurry
to group boats two minutes
let's build a bank
the boat crew
untie this tie untie the knots
all in the boats
let's go
we're going
ready deep bangs…
hold hold hold
what is that  
what are they doing  
they are sensors that detect things by reflection
that's how they move
they have to catch up
they rise out of the water
otherwise they will become deaf
the fighter
come here
go
go there
go
they try to separate the main person from others
using sound bombs
their target is the mother because the baby swims first
and he won't leave the baby
will they fight back  
not never lifted a finger
but a hard part to kill
submarines go
freeing
releasing
here is our girl
the target is visible
harpoon at the ready
here baby
did you see us coming from below  
there are gaps in the shield
ok ok get up
i leave
coming closer
stay straight
take the target
got the goal
one is right
two are ready
take the goal
shoot
a good shot the second one
take the target
sent two
boo
great
you owe us a beer
did you see because of the bags his speed is reduced
he is kept on the surface
yes
catch him
take me there
directly to him
30 meters
harpoons with explosives
ten meters take me there keep close
now straight straight
stay with him
wait wait
the rope goes
grab the ponytail colonel
completely back off
pull back
catch up
catch up
an explosive harpoon hit him in the chest
he's still running
beautiful
the only way to approach the gland is from the ground
we rock it up until it's tight
inside the brain
these people are very intelligent animals
maybe smarter than us
not smarter than me
that is a small value
hey i had the harpoon
yes
how do you know
that they are smarter than us  
more neurons more roads
not only are they smart they
very sensitive
very spiritual
see this is the part that works with our emotions
but looking at the proportions this is very big
they know music
the view
mathematics
complex languages
ok
here
show me the money
did all this for this too  
that's right
amrita
bad luck for big friends
these things can stop people from aging
stop
ounce for ounce is worth a lot
elements to man
this little bottle is worth it…
80 million
think fast
please don't
this is not a joke
amrita now pays for everything in pandora
even for your research isn't that right dr g  
that's why i drink
how much do you guys buy  
i mean waste the rest  
put the bags
let's drown him
not leave the bags
i want to tell them this is us
i charge more to be used as bait
his name is ro'a
she is my soul sister
he is a songwriter
very rewarding
we sing songs together
he went through many breeding cycles to make this baby
the gang was very happy with him
what is this tonovari  
what is this  
my soul sister and her baby…
killed by sky men
this war is upon us
we came to know about this hunt
from our tulkun people
but that is beyond the horizon
very far
now here it is
you can't
you need to understand how celestial people think
they don't think about environmental balance
we don't care about sky people
listen listen to him
heaven does not stop people
this is just the beginning
you tell your tulkuns to go
you tell them to go away

manjulika
manjulika

we both have the same image
but the opinions are very different
father thought that he would grow up slowly
but we didn't know
with timemanjulika's madness is also increasing
his world is different
dark illusions tantra mantras
and the dark world of agorians
manju was very fond of kuvar
he began to love her from his heart
i'm sorry i'm sorry
sodureeven if i die for you
love this heart
uncomfortably
hope my heart
nube's heart beat is the melody
my heart beats
desires of my heart
it is your image that adorns
from the sound of my ringsi hear your voice
this distance is always
bringing us closer

a girl like youshould not have been born
if god had given me an only daughter
i won't leave you today
i won't leave you
it went wellanjulica does not do dark illusions
or you will sayhow well anjulica does dark magic
manjulika learns from him
you used to yell at me every day
never loved mewhy

but even after death manjulika did not get peace
before manjulika's soul disturbs anyone else

and then finally
at your end
what are you doing now  
a disaster
it was a disaster
for 18 years that ghostly soul was trapped
you cannot imagine how angry he was
now he is stronger
imprisoning him again
it won't be easy

his heart rate drops where were we
we are trying to finish this now
griot give me the reins
your wish princess
what is the measure of success  
25%
let's try another way
king t'challa's heartbeat
decreased to 31 beats per minute
princess you had better go to him
i want to think everyone get out
going out
what is the measure of success  
291%
make it
princess i know about urgency
but i must warn you
this artificial heartshaped plant
there is little opportunity to produce what is needed
i don't care it should work
griot
are they princesses  
what is my brother's heart rate  
your brother
together with the ancients
not
we thank king t'challa for his gifts
black panther
son of king t'chaka
my son
descended from his highness king bashenga
the first black panther
we set you free
respect the elders
(a song in a foreign language)
i'm sorry i'm sorry
a year later
this is my honor
summon her majesty queen ramonda
lulumba's daughter
independent ruler of the kingdom of wakanda
mr chairman
i believe i speak for all these members
as i said i've been very underwhelmed
to the failure of wakanda
join the worldwide effort to keep their promise
solve international challenges
share resources
and full support
regarding vibranium
france has received information that vibranium can be used in the production of weapons of mass destruction
no metal detector can detect them
it is a threat to world security and underdeveloped countries
now i give the opportunity
to her majesty queen ramonda
that has always been our policy
never share vibranium for any reason
it's not because of the dangerous state of vibranium
it is because of your dire circumstances
wakanda external relations center ansongo mali
i lost the security camera footage
crawl on the floor now
face down go go
where are the vibranium weapons  
who can enter  
you are showing civility here
but we know what you're whispering
in your leadership boards
and in your military bases
the king died
black panther is no more
they lost their protector
now is our time
attack
aneka where is your spear  
champion gave me this to test
you know i like it
our leader gave the spear
because it's a perfect beautiful
and deadly
that will not change under my rule
ok general
i told you not to bring them
there was another attack last night
ours is to an external contact center
evidence of the relationship of these member states
your mobiles will get it now
identify the attackers
kneel down
your chance
our gracious response to this invasion
like an olive branch
future efforts on our resources
considered as an initiative for a fight
and expect a deeper response
we mourn the loss of our king
but don't think for a second
the wakanda government says his abilities have diminished
protect our resources
we have become aware of the actions of some
find vibranium outside of wakanda
i wish you all the best for that
atlantic ocean
this is the 625th rotor
request permission to land
ok see you down below
ok
i thought you were retired
i thought so too
they said the machine has a one in a billion chance
find vibranium
less than that
here there is
internal pressure is stable
at a negative atmospheric pressure (this is actually impossible)
at 800 feet
crossing the temperature change threshold
all my life safety systems are working fine
became aware
we came down
great so salzar
you are near the workplace
yes that's great
excavator found
an element like iron
whatever it is it's strong
i've never seen a needle get crushed like this
that's true
vibranium is at the bottom of the ocean
let's go ahead and take out the detector (vibranium detector)
because that's all we have
we go to the vibranium detector
ok salsar we suddenly got dark
yes the drilling machine lost power
ok i'll fix it here
what the hell is this  
jackson
tell me what do you see  
wait salzar's heartbeat
hey salsar can i have a look  
it's a phantom jellyfish
i have never seen one this color
emergency dive team get ready
salzar we lost jackson's signals
do you see him
not he's gone
describe   what do you mean by lost  
salzar can you hear me  
salzar  
smitty we have a problem here
what's that sound
west can you find out what that noise is  
west how are you  
west do you see  
it's like a sonic assault
hey smitty plug your ears
we are being attacked
you guys send a strike team right now
ok an emergency an emergency this is the 625 rotary
we are waiting for urgent help
those are wakandans
it should be so
henderson

henderson
let's go

pulling us back
my goodness
my goodness catch it
queen ramonda of wakanda
gave a quick speech at the united nations general assembly
members of her army
captured people were brought
into the federation
it's been a year since queen ramonda
appointed as the ruler of the kingdom of wakanda
after the sudden death of king t'challa
last year due to an undiagnosed illness
all eyes are on the small powerful state
when that state keeps trying to be alone
my queen
reaching the river border
we are home
princess
just wait
i am at work
i understand princess but
you interrupt my train of thought
champion
mother
i was going to tell you
the queen has arrived
 thank you  it makes me nervous
i think one day
artificial intelligence is killing us all
my ai is not like in the movies (artificial intelligence)
it does exactly what i say
yes children are like that
everyone seems to be working hard
yes rapid emergency response unit
countless
there may be unknown threats
they are looking for answers
ah what is this  
an outer garment for our army
this gives the user superhuman powers
speed and durability
but as always okoye has notes
what are his notes  
he doesn't like them
what happened to the heartshaped plant  
did you make any progress on it  
sorry princess
nakia ya's daughter is calling you again
maybe you
maybe you should continue your calculations
as i said
your wish princess
we don't want the plant mom
we need new technology
what happens to black panther  
that veil brought our nations together for centuries
black panther is an artifact mom
i was born from the plant not to save the face veil
i made it to save my brother
ah champion
do you know today  
tuesday
date baby
the day the brother died
one year today
have you planned anything  
yes it also includes taking your mother on a trip
 right now    right now
you can leave your kimoyo beads here
 mother  no no
you don't need them where we're going
the other two too yes
you have to sit here with me with you too
that's the only way you can get well
from the wounds from t'challa's death
i'm fine mom
you don't have to worry about me
he's gone but i'm moving on
t'challa is dead
but that doesn't mean he's gone
when that illness took your brother from us
i had to lead a wounded nation and a broken world
but i'm still in the jungle
i walk until i meet the water
then i sit down
after that i will perform this puja
now i'm going to show you
i found your brother in the breeze
when i was pushed early
like his hands on my shoulders
it took a while
but he was there
he wasn't there mom
that feeling you had
a product of your mind
it came out to give you comfort or pleasure
that is all
hmm
what's on your mind  
when you think about your brother  
does that make you feel better  
or a hive  
come on baby
how did you get this  
does it work  
what does this have to do with sacrifice  
burning funeral clothes
marking the end of the time of mourning
beginning of new relationships
be with our loved ones
i'm not doing this mom
if i sit down
if you think about my brother for a long time
i am not burning these clothes
it's this world
everyone in this
champion
champion i have something to tell you
about your brother
mom wait
what are you doing
it is better if this is not part of your offering
not like that
stop right there
who are you how did you get into this  
it's charming here
the air is excellent
and water
my mother told me stories about a place like this
a preserved land that does not want to go back
they don't want to change who they are
what are your reasons  
reveal your secret to the world  
i am not a woman who wants to repeat what i said
who are you
i have many names
my people call me k'uk'ulkan
but my enemies are namor
the american military discovered vibranium
at the border of my nation
i was able to stop them from digging
but we need help in wakanda
prevent it from happening again
they used a machine invented by an american scientist
vibranium is only found here
in wakanda
mom he's covered in it
your son showed the world the power of vibranium
in response other nations began
find them all over the world
his choice put us in trouble
i think wakanda can find the scientist
bring it to me  
the only fair thing is to help wakanda solve our predicament
you have sneaked into my country
don't tell me about fair
i have more soldiers than the grass on this earth
they have incredible strength
i don't want to come back under any circumstances
when you find the scientist blow on this
put in the sea
i'll get to that in a moment
your own good
don't say anything about me
to anyone outside of wakanda
did you see the wings on his wrists  
how did he do it  
we need to gather the congregation
no one has any evidence
about any activity
ah the security of the ganga border is breached isn't it  
if my soldiers were there
this fish man
we will be sitting in front of you as we speak
if your fleshy brains were there
they will still be here
pinning their fancy dresses
you balddemon
respect you both
honor  
these people should be ashamed to show their faces
control your voice jabari
like i said
there is no record of him in any air defense system
and not on the radar either
that means he swam 100 kilometers under water
he was not alone
he said he has a big army
he wants to bring one american scientist  
can they kill him  
do
we have never met an enemy
using vibranium
there is no black panther to protect us
that's why this intelligent council
allowed killmonger to take the crown
and burn all of you precious heartshaped saplings
m'baku what do you have to say  
we need to find the fish man and kill him
if we do what he says now
why does he stop coming back  
and stop asking for more  
stay as you were
is it me or does this keep getting uglier  
it's you
 does this work    yes
this can be found
a different frequency in vibranium
from water from stones from big iron
the person who made this is awesome
come and see
some parts are made separately others as seen
it looks like it was collected from a garbage heap
i still can't believe it
out of wakanda with vibranium
perhaps there is more than one asteroid
our planet has the most water
that may be why
the other is falling there
it changes everything we know
ancient mt every legend story
those stories are hard in my heart
it's like a lot of pain
that means we have to find the scientist
 i have an idea  hmm
i want the princess
it doesn't work
he is not fit to work outside
my queen
it would be good for him to get out
that might be what he really wants
also i can do an american mission
do it with your eyes closed
i am not worried about the americans
this is neymar
he came from behind our security ring
it will never happen again
he did not come alone
he will stay with me
so
when are we going
i can see my favorite colony
alexandria virginia
wow
come on
ok i understood
i understood
going slow  
didn't you feel like calling  
why do i have your number  
we are looking for a scientist
created a vibranium detector
so you guys were in atlantic  
come on drilling vessel
many injured
what happened
really  
it was a joint operation army and marines
thirty of their best men two of our best officers
my friends
lost
like that
you are stating the facts
they're looking for vibranium
i can say with responsibility that wakanda has nothing to do with it
so who is that  
god if this is meant to be
i give you information you give it something
for our own safety we can't tell you
what is essential now is that we should find the scientist
before anything else happens
you owe me ross
you owe my brother
ok
the officers have been sentenced to death
i said less than this
we have a new director
she watched me like a hawk
we will be very very careful
not careful you have to be fast
america needs another machine
this child is the only person in the world
know how to make it
so they come for her
a child  
cambridge massachusetts
 hey  you didn't venmo me (a money transfer app)
i forgot that is it 800

primitive
my queen
we found the scientist
she is american
wakanda came from a rural school
from a school  
please tell me it's a professor
he's a student mom

you
wow
you are the champion princess
what the hell are you doing here  
ah will you marry me  
i came here about the vibranium detector
you made it to the cia (central intelligence agency)
i didn't make any detectors for the cia
i made it for my metallurgy class
 a school project    yes
my professor said i couldn't do it
because he's young capable and black right  
you probably wouldn't say that in wakanda
how old are you  
combustion
being smart at a young age
old people are not always welcome
how long did it take you  
a few months
 how many months    that was the hard part
finding metal sheets large enough to cover
wait did i piss off wakanda  
not only us
this place is no longer safe for you
gather your things and come with me now
i have differential equations class in 15 minutes
ok
ok

it doesn't seem like much
but this is my whole life's work
hmmm
and the design information of that machine is in this  
yes
you just leave it in a garage  
i have a secret code of 2065 bytes in this
that's great are you stuck in it  
it took about four months to reenter
i had to build a quantum computer
just crack my secret code
what are you doing here is this stark technology   (ion man stark)
i said don't touch anything
princesses american law firms

princess there is a spy plane
 keep on top of you  how high  
at 30000 feet
wait
i will take care of it
ok riri
you have to find those differential equations
after the relative velocities become equal
riri i'm not sure you can go near that plane
without an oxygen mask
oxidation rate 55%
28000 feet
oxygen content 30%
maximum acceleration i want to fix it
my angle
it should fall right up
0% oxygen
the plane is no longer following you
high 500 feet and falls
riri are you ok
 riri  yes
i am fine
 coming  get out of my way
 chic  don't worry

my professor gave an assignment
when something is discovered researchers are told…
an unimaginable person
talking to outsiders won't do any good
i am pleading

i have met him too
sometimes we see a shadow of the man with wings on his leg
at that beach
we thought he was a spirit
k'uk'ulkan
our winged god
in this kingdom and below the kingdom
i really like to see that beach
be careful
k'uk'ulkan has been there longer than you and i
others who searched for him
holes in their hearts
never came back
lost in the depths
forever
princess
accept
please be free
this is beautiful
it's my mother's
these are all mesoamerican artifacts (part of south america in the past)
often in the 16th century
have you been around since then  
your mother is human
that's right
then he became someone else
 how    how  
the how was never as important as the why
bc 1571 zuma yucatan
my mother and her village
lived by farming
at that time the spanish invaders brought smallpox
harsh language and otherworldly doctrine
faced with anger
war and pestilence
my people turned to chak (god of rain lightning storm)
our god of rain and fertility
chuck showed our dragon a vision
a way to save our people
chuck told him the way to a plant growing on a blue stone
my mother was pregnant because of me in those days
so she refused to take the plant
because i'm afraid it will affect me
but yakandura was convinced
your child is sick
only this can save him
your baby is the first born in our new home
as a promise to get this gift
he will be our new king
they all got sick
their lives
being there
finished
that plant took away our ability to breathe
but it gave the ability to absorb oxygen from the sea
they settled in the sea
away from war and pestilence
let's go
my mother gave birth to me there
i am the first child born in talokan
that plant gave me the wings of the ankle
and two ears pointing to the clouds
i have changed
i can swim in the sky reduce age
breathe the gas that our ancestors breathed
as she grew older
why was my mother sad about the land life she knew
died of a broken heart
she took a promise from me
to bury her in her hometown
i was not prepared for what i found there
whose child is that  
shoot
shoot
your art is a devil
son of satan
a spanish man cursed me
when he dies by my hand
he told me
you are a loveless child
a child without love
a child without love
i took my name from it
nemor
because i have no love for the surface world
why are you telling me these things  
then you will understand why i want to kill this scientist
what if we take him to wakanda  
let us go
i give you my word
he will stay in my country
i can't risk it princess
so keep me instead
i would love to see your race
you can't wear that and go downstairs
body temperature will drop and you will pass out soon
your blood will be poisoned
and the pressure of the sea
all your bones will break
or you can wear a diving suit
we have quite a few of them come on
stay close
hey nemore wait
wow
taloqan is the capital
hello
it's beautiful
it is made of vibranium
yes
in this depth of the sea
i brought the sun to my people
i know you like it
save the scientist's life
but now you see what i have to protect
nakia your suspicion is correct
i found champi's kimoyo karabu place
the signal comes from a cave under the sea
approximately 140 meters below the surface
queen mother i found the signal
it comes from under the sea
if he is under it
i'm sure i'll have objections
how do you respond  
bring back the princess no matter what
i'll try to get nemor out
you are the first person to come from the surface
to these talocans
please accept this as a token of our gratitude
this is made from the plant talokan saved
you are young princess
when you get old like me you will understand
we all lose loved ones
but when i lost my brother
it felt different
he suffered in silence
when he finally asked me for help i couldn't
how do you understand
the ancients have given me abilities and gifts
save my brother but i could not  
i don't have an answer to that question
my ancestors often say
only the most hurtful people can be good leaders
i appreciate what you have done here
and the way you protect your people
but as the princess of wakanda
i will not let you kill that young woman
my people will not stay until i go back
i will not go without him
we need to find a peaceful way to resolve this
this is not about the scientist anymore
for centuries surface nations
people like us were defeated and enslaved
because of resources
since the day my mother was buried
i prepared my men
for the day they come looking for us
that machine is the signal to say now is the right time
i want to know if wakanda is our enemy or our friend
there is nothing in between
your plan is to make war on the whole world
asking for help in wakanda for that  
that's crazy
no nation can rob wakanda
if you get a chance
if we get together
we can protect each other by attacking them first
then after the threat of these nations is over
i will send the scientist back to wakanda
what if wakanda didn't accept it  
the scientist will die
wakanda will be the first kingdom to be destroyed
attack my people  
yes
i want you to hear me
wakanda cannot win a war against the talokan
i heard that night
by the river with your mother
you said you wanted to burn the world
let's burn it together
central intelligence agency lanley virginia
queen ramonda
we don't sell vibranium
now they kidnapped the young woman
that machine was made
yes respectfully
riri williams is a child expert
all of his professors revolved around him
the wakandans take him in
to their external relations program
nothing else after that
you sent a swat team undercover at night ()
arrest the crown princess
an international superpower
the president wants to take criminal action
against wakanda
what kind of criminal proceedings  
overthrow the government
special officer ross is our expert
ross what do you think  
my resources are
there are other people here
 another race    could be i don't know
you guys give me time
find out about this
or we will be in the middle of a war
with one country military capability
we can't even compare
director  
i think he is an expert
i think attacking wakanda was a mistake
yes
we have a problem
cural velho verde point
is my daughter alive  
the princess lives well
he asked to be taken to talokan
he will be there until the time is right
what can i give instead of him  
nothing
i am pleading
americans accuse the government of wakanda
when you attacked their mining ship
send back my daughter and the scientist
or i'll tell them about you
if you tell americans about us
or if you try to find us
or if you see one wakanda ship at sea
i will kill the princess
i'm coming to wakanda
come and kill you
so what happened  
he wants to go to war with the surface world
he asked me for help
i want to think
we're never leaving here
put the spear down
kill the princess
put down your knife
you
you killed him
let him go
you won't die then
champion
shake your left hand
are you ok
are you ok  
 give me your beads  let's go
give me his bead to save him
we have to go
champion i don't know who he is
but we have to listen to him
listen i hit him with a sonic rock
it is deadly from this distance no chance
you don't understand this is a war
 we have to go  wait
did they bully you  
no no
thank you
a trifle
— griot  they are queens
take us to wakanda right now
what happened my child  
people from wakanda
they came looking for him
k'uk'ulkan
can you save me  
is he dead
yes
sleep baby
they came
when you talk to the queen  
we should not have believed him
the princess saw our house
what's stopping them  
coming back to taloqan  
i will do
long live taloqan
long live taloqan
long live taloqan
long live taloqan
i was blinded
with hope
about a partner
now
i got in trouble
all of us
taloqan

namor
atuma
after we finish them off
they never think
get in
to the talokan
long live taloqan

i want to return these

you got that down there didn't you  
is it true that you saw an underwater kingdom  
 yes  hmm
it's beautiful
but these people are dangerous aneka
hmm
so miss riri williams
what do you think about wakanda  
stories have not done this place justice
this is great
but i really want to go home
you will have to be patient
can i at least talk to mom  
bring the princess home
a water dog called nakia
may hanuman win
may hanuman win
once again the spies saved wakanda
the queen will give him gifts
banned for life i'm sure of it
okoye
thank you sister
after thanos' invasion
when you leave without saying a word
it hurt
i regret not being there with you
it is not easy
he
king and black panther for all
but for me
he is everything
my t'challa
when he was taken from me it was just like i

i stopped talking with mom

warrior

nakia
we will find your mother right  
opinionated man
the security forces have been directed outside the palace

wait what   leave you here  
run
okoye go now

queen

 mother mother  bury your dead
grieve the loss
you are the queen now
mother
get away from me mother
mother
mother
mother
mother
arise my queen
let me see
get up

mother

mother
jabariland mourns your loss
be sad for yourself
according to the sacrifices of your ancestors
don't bury yourself in your technology
why did you come here
i promised your brother
i will give you advice and
safety
but i need your advice today
the elders of your tribe came to me
making a proposal
they like to evict the townspeople and set up camp
in jabariland
now you are interested in asking a child
ridiculing rituals  
hmm
the world
the world has taken a lot from you
therefore you cannot think that you are still a child
my people are eager to know
which way does your mind bend  
adults are desperate
the city may be in danger
give them what they want if you can
they will owe you a lot
what's in your heart  
which way does your heart bend  
i just buried the last person who really understood me
bury my heart with him
come on
your olive oil is about to go bad
what are you doing here
i'm hungry so
a tragedy has occurred in the international community
sources are now confirming
queen ramonda lumumba's daughter is dead
western allies say a civil crisis
the queen's
do you have something to say  
i can't imagine what your friends are hiding from you
what are you talking about  
i have no known connection with the kingdom of wakanda
and what about beads  
what
beads
i put a secret device on them
before you get there
i've been listening to every conversation you've had
with your treasonous talk with the queen
may she rest in peace
but that's good
to us
ok do you know the wakandans saved my life
 they are good people  hmmm
did you think for a second  
what are they doing  
ever wondered what we would do  
what if america was the only country with vibranium  
i really dreamed about it
val please
that's the director of aquatics
your mother protected me as one of hers
the least i can do is to reciprocate
we need to find a way to weaken namor
although weak he will still be a problem
black panther has never failed to protect wakanda
i thought there was no black panther
my brother died
but that doesn't mean there is no black panther
a griot  
let's start with a comparative analysis
make our efforts
artificial heartshaped plant and
with fibers taken from this garment
they are princesses
it was formed because of the presence of vibranium
they may share the same things
take advantage of us
anything you like princess
please put my brother's dna with this
putting now
why don't these look the same  
his appearance is completely different
none of them fly or have two ears like this one
the women who guarded us
their mouths were watering
and the neck
he doesn't have them
some organisms do not need caramel
remove oxygen from water so
it's like a jellyfish
he absorbs oxygen through his skin
that process is called
 diffusion  diffusion
every day that passes without choosing our ruler
a waste
we must face namor
before bringing his fighters here
how can we fight someone with so much power  
in that attack before your plane was hit
he jumped back into the water
what's going on if that's how he gets his energy  
he gasps for air get oxygen
with water using his skin
if we can find a way dry him
he won't be that strong
dude that's right
griot we need to modify the royal talon battleship
to a drying evaporation chamber
is that possible  
yes
you're going to help us trap him
show miss williams where she has to work
from this side
how old are you
when making the first machine  
it's three
my uncle is an auto mechanic he wanted to build airplanes
he gave me these weapons and let me learn about them myself
so who taught you to do what you do  
my big brother
i am the tip of the spear that is the wakanda army
this is not me
besides i'm normal now
i also surrendered my weapon
i also made you a new spear
a new one  
yes
what is the name of this flower  
midnight goddess
midnight goddess  
listen to me
this can be equal with them
sister i want you to be ready when i say
please
champion
yes
how many of these did you make  
i looked for you at the jabari checkpoint
i cannot be forced out of my house
you have a religious spirit
why did you join dora  
why you ask
mine and hers still have battles left
tell me aneka kyana's daughter
does your sister still have battles left  
what's on your mind
griot
what is the success rate  
987% princess
would you like to print out a heartshaped plant  
hey champion
i thought you had been to haiti by now
i am still a wakanka
this is what you do then
yes
what you have now
a chance to bring back wakanda's protector
that is the greatest gift possible
after bashenga's discovery
we will find out soon
 griot    yes princess
print
how do we know it's working  
it glows
you did it
i mean we are now
want to light something like incense  
who knows exactly
how are the ancients brought to this laboratory  
are you sure you don't want to be buried  
let you come closer to my heart
if you have a sudden heart attack
a heart attack  
he is joking
right  
right  
let this heartshaped plant
give yourself the power of the black panther
and lead you to the ancients
ramonda
we beg you come to your daughter
mother  
n'jadaka
my sister in law
how  
the how is never as important as the why right  
you chose me
can't be i will never choose you
why did you take the plant  
 see my family  not that's nonsense
you didn't believe the ancients were real
isn't it  
so why did you get it  
you don't have to lie to me
be strong for me
do you have the strength to do anything  
did you see
we are more alike than you think
i took it to get revenge on my exes
i'm not like you
you bought it for yourself
then everything was destroyed
a useless king
afraid that someone else will come
just a coward
i had the strength to do it
things that need to change wakanda
how many people are like your scientist  
protected wakanda before i took the crown  
cowards
they were the ones who came to me before the panthers
before t'challa
don't talk about my brother
you are the reason he died
you destroyed the plant you lost our protector
then namor attacked and killed my mother
their blood on your hands
they are not mine
you can't
keep it away from your mother
he sacrificed his life to protect
a young girl is a lost breed
your father he is a hero
if he had he would have killed the girl
shik he killed his own brother
t'challa is too gentlemanly
he allowed your father's murderer to live
now you are here
are you trying to be a gentleman like your brother  
or do the work
like me
are you ok
are you ok
who did you see
no one
what is going on  
i am a failure
 it didn't work  hey champion
 they left me  they never do that
i did everything i had to do
 i made the plant again  okay
i sacrificed your stupidity for what  
 calm down  why didn't they come for me  
calm down
shik
can't i have some too  
i guess
you will need a dress
more people are coming from the city
they need more space
why
you are strangers
it's amazing how everything happens with you guys
princess
he did it
black panther lives
namor believes that wakanda is on its knees
our queen was murdered
our capital was destroyed
he believes we are defenseless
but now
now is our time to attack
how come we don't even know how to find him  
bring us namor
 here again    do not
somewhere in the sea
ok
let's assume this goes well
hmm let's think we can kill him
that flying hulklike strength
is killing him the right solution  
you asked for his head
his only crime was when he was threatened
what is this difference lord m'baku  
his soldiers
he was not called the general or the king
they called him k'uk'ulkan
what is that  
a winged serpent god
what
you think because we live in the mountains
do we not get to read books  
adults
with your permission
i would like to speak with his highness m'baku alone
 okay  okay
namor is not finished
he promised to destroy the surface world
now's our chance to catch him
 what are you afraid of    to war
if namor is a god to his people
killing him leads to eternal war
and so  
is my mother's life not worth an eternal war  
definitely worth it
definitely worth it
but that is not what he expects from you
i don't want that either
for my people
you talk about my mother as if she still exists
like he expected me to
his hopes and dreams
but he is dead
he's gone
namor killed him before my eyes
his dreams
his goals his hopes for me
they are gone now
they don't matter anymore
work is what i want
i want namor dead
you help me do it
is it clear  
we leave in the morning
hi
good morning
if we survive this
i want to tell you you have a house with me in haiti
here take my hands
take a breath
champion i want you to be honest with me
who did you see after taking the plant  
if you go to war for revenge
the void left by his loss will not be filled
it's only getting bigger
it will finish you too
it already is
k'uk'ulkan another device to find vibenium has been dropped into the sea
where is  
atlantic ocean
stay out of the water
for the queen
pambili
riri how are you doing  
hey mr griot
now is the time for me to get that help
i thought you wouldn't ask
shik
shik he is fast
but i'm faster than that
woohoo
i caught you
now it's up to you champion
 princess  not
i am the black panther and i am here to deliver consequences
dehydration cells are on
what's wrong
would you like a glass of water
 we caught him  good
namor caught up
back off
back to wakanda
get out
what is going on  
the acoustic transmitter is destroyed
that is not good
panther the sea tiger has lost his power
they are in significant danger
okoye
panther
pambili
many
okoye
it's time
pambili
for wakanda
wakanda
griot what's the harm  
a great calamity
his spear is made of raw vibranium
the plane can be blown up at any time
take us to the desert
do not
sink the ship
i'll take you sister
wait
soldiers
do you speak my language
you can greet the old
stay away from me
okay come here
congratulate your seniors
may the ancients save us
if the princess did not hurry
we will join them
if so hey
let's take as many of them as possible
this could have been different
i want water
are you trying to be great  
like your brother
or take care of business
like me
i am not my brother
namor will apologize to me
as i stood and watched him die
i am the emperor
forever wakanda
champion
mother
show him
who are you
surrender
wakanda protects your seas
we will keep your secrets
surrender
then your people will live
revenge destroys us
we cannot sacrifice our people for it
i surrender
people of taloqan
let's go back home
our battle is over here
forever wakanda
forever wakanda
thank you my dear
dude
is everything ready to go home  
if you are sure the police
he said he was not at the airport to catch me
don't worry i took care of it
but you have to work hard
your homeworkforhire business
slipped and got caught i can't help it
did they say they wanted to tell you something  
yes
your dress it's a good design
but you can't take it away
no problem
i understood what i could do
fixing what happened to wakanda because of my mess
i have something else to show you
come on
it took some time to find the parts of the car
but it worked
how are you
this is my father's car
we made this back then
 are you sure this is it    every part
i will send this to boston
get this before you go
come here man
panther miss williams' car has arrived
take care of yourself
are you sure you're not coming to chicago  
even see a buffalo game  
sounds like fun
but i have something to do first
now i present
princess suri
black panther
black panther sent her best wishes
but today she will not join us
i am baku
the leader of the jabari types
someone from wakanda
likes to challenge
for the crown
why are you upset my child  
i was waiting to fight my life with you
the thought of you kneeling before the wakandans
black panther had every reason to kill me
why do you think he didn't  
black panther is the most powerful person in the world
the most powerful nation on the surface
but he has no friendly state
now she feels sad for talokan people
with this friendship
talokhan will be stronger than ever
the surface world will come for wakanda
wakanda will turn to us
believe me
what the hell is this  
can't we turn around  
i don't know we will be an hour late
why don't you go and see  
ok
this is the shower
yes apparently a tree has fallen and blocked the road
what are we doing
what
ah
the colonist in chains
now i can see everything
great
let's go
thank you
thank you
a trifle
hey
accept
nice to see you too
everything is ready
will you give me some time

stay tuned as there is more to come
champion

we agreed that it would be better for him to grow up here
away from the pressure of a crown
your father
your grandpa
prepared us for his death didn't we  
but he didn't want us to go to the funeral
because he knew that the time had not yet come
so we had our own ceremony here
did my mother meet him

toussaint is a beautiful name
it has a long history

i like these diamonds
for the idea of ​​this mobile
but how to take this to india  
as soon as your money reaches our agent
we start your delivery
but what if something goes wrong after giving the money  
that won't happen sir we do this in parallel
but our sir is not an ordinary person the minister of home affairs

nothing will come out sir ankit will take care of everything
your diamond will be the courier in this case
its identity will remain a secret
this case starts with several numbers
half of it is for you the remaining half is for us
also the phone has a sim card with gps
it will always be tracked
the sim card is tracked
if someone throws away the sim card and runs away with the phone  
if someone touches the sim i get a message
if someone takes the whole box and runs away whose sim will they track  
sir please understand what i am saying
 sir  yes  
once you pay your diamond is insured
after that if there is a delivery problem we will be responsible for it
that's what was needed
sir madam take responsibility

we are going to start a family ankit do you understand that  
 they haven't done anything to our family  ankit
neha
 you should have not hit the girl  ankit too
what happened sister  
why did you remember me after so many years  
are you back in business  
are you working or away  
can't say that what's the matter
need to take revenge on someone
i understood that from your call
but you know that i don't just work
ping is busy
 diamonds worth 120 crores  what  
the story about the diamond is right it is also right to take revenge on that wretch
but why do you have to do it on the plane  
diamond is connected to a gps
before and after take off there will always be surveillance
the opportunity comes in between
besides we have a great relationship with airplanes
then i will switch the diamonds to knock him unconscious you just send and take away
i don't just want diamonds i want sudhamanshu
i want to hear it scream
i need to get rid of it so that i can be remembered
what do you want to do  
 a plane takes off  what  
hijack a plane  
are you really saying you are not crazy  
if you are caught stealing you will be imprisoned for three years
if you are caught hijacking you will be hanged
tell me if you want to do it or someone will come for 120 crores
what did he do to you  
took a life
whose
i trust sudhanshu and sudhanshu trusts you all
so accept you will receive your money after a week of work
we don't talk about work on the phone
you will receive your tickets
to albarkat
the passengers of the hijacked plane have not yet come out
according to our sources this has been stopped for internal questioning
what are these questions for  
we have not received proper details about this yet
why didn't you bring hot water to the sit  
can i have some hot water very hot
is the husband telling me to do that work from the sit  
if something happened the other would pick me up and throw me
but the biryani that was given was completely eaten
eat the biryani on an empty stomach sir
now there are so many questions about biryani
again biryani is not even touched in your planes
sir the flight commando was sitting in the seat in front of me
a flight attendant came and gave him the floor glass before everyone else
when i asked i could not give it sir
 do you want something sir    i'll have a mixed fruit juice
sorry sir
fruit juice
the girl took the order from delhi
but the south indian girl came
yes i remember south indian girl
sir neha is busy so i moved it
but he gave what he asked for
are you saying that a man drank fruit juice and slept for four hours  
i don't know sir
maybe he is tired
i promise
we will definitely find out what happened on the plane
has anyone been hit in real life  
so what were you thinking  
i thought the other passengers would join
but no one came
after that we didn't do anything
 they pointed a gun at my head  they also shouted at my child
sir that boy developed asthma
what happened son  
he then went to business class
that boy tried to go to business class time and time again
there was something wrong with him even before the kidnapping
after some time a hijacker took him and said that this man is lying
 what were you looking for on the plane    nothing sir why  
so what did you do in the galley with the airhosters  
sir i had a problem with my meal i went to solve it
so did you get a call during take off and talk about a problem with the camera  
no sir it's a business emergency
it was during the initial take off that the business emergency came
after that i talked about the two things
sir you don't think that i was together with the hijackers do you  
i don't say that you say that
 no sir me too  shut up
could it be   can be
those who did the hijacking only hit you and you went to them again and again
you are the one who planted that fake bomb
 why    sir how do i know i need to ask them sir
passengers are still being questioned at kulu airport
but about the identity of the bandits
no information was given to the media
 can you identify those robbers    no sir
 they were covering their faces  sent black
but all three looked the same
jinu varghese
 from delhi    no sir i am from kochi
 did you go to delhi for a job    not
getting a plane from al barkat to kochi is difficult
 do you have the ticket for the other plane    yes sir
this will be fine
 how tall are you    what sir  
how tall are you
five past eleven
who was sitting next to you  
sir i have something to give you
when the plane was hijacked i secretly videotaped them
i will show you sir this
mobin al ansar will liberate kashmir with god's help
sir went on a tourist visa to find a job
but not found
 did you come back in five days    sir
there is nothing like what you read about this gulf
these sheikhs are making us slaves keep the passport
sir even if a man works from his own country for a meager salary he cannot enslave anyone
did you understand all that in five days  
sir it took two days to understand
if i had seen the condition of the friend who called me for a job
that man didn't pick up my phone so i made a ticket and came
but look at my fate hijacked
but i will try again
my cousin's boy drives taxi in australia
driving taxi speaking english sir everyone in dubai speaks hindi
there are approximately 150 passengers on this plane
their families and relatives are worried
they want to know about their family
they feel very helpless
at the end
did you find the diamond  
diamonds were foundbut they sent lies
lie  
 how do you know    i brought a diamond expert
he confirmed it
that omar bin's guythe courier
he says there was a mixup with his bag on the plane
god
wait a minute
yes ranjith  
sir we have to hold another press conference
 why    that hijack is fake
and the bomb is also fake
and the hijackers are not dead
and that air marshal
he has disappeared
he is also a liar
but i told everything to the media
i understand that sir but we have to change the statement
are you crazy ranjith  
my statement was aired on all channels
the government will take it as a joke
sir then what do we do  
wait till my next order
until then keep your mouth shut
listen bhagat it's not a hijack it's a robbery
what
someone hijacked it and made our diamonds disappear
that means our diamonds are gone but don't worry sir
that madam assured us that we were insured
you talk to omar bin once
we will not lose
you finish work there and come back
the story of diamond theft cannot go forward
sir i came to india to help my friend i put money into his business
but why did it go from muscat to al barkat and reach delhi  
actually all my friends live in albarkat
they have the money that's it
but nowadays money is being transacted from the internet
why did i go there if it was such a transcirculation  
no they will give you some money only after following up a bit
 that too for a friend you understand right    understood
did you see someone in your seat during the hijacking  
yes sir you must have seen it
then they told me to raise and lower my hands
and even our seats were changed from business class
who was next to you  
near me that tall one gone now
but he said that someone else was sitting next to him
 no sir he is tall  did anyone see you in that seat  
is there anyone
is there anyone
he gave her the juice before anyone else
even if i asked i couldn't give it
the girl from delhi took the order
sir neha is busy so i gave it away
neha grover
 yes    sir
who is this
you smuggled diamonds on the plane didn't you  
that story is about to go to the media
if you go to the mussels you will be in big trouble
are anonymous callers intimidating  
but you should know that i will find all of you
100%
no need to search for your message sir
neha grover who is neha grover  
who is neha grover  
neha grover  
yes sir
is neha grover  
called in
tell me this why did you give sudhanshu roy a drink before another  
sir sudhanshu roy  
that rogue flight marshal is the one who just disappeared
ok sir he himself asked for a drink
and bhanu yadav  
excuse me sir bhanu yadav  
out there is a real flight marshal
ok i didn't know he was a flight marshal
so tell me this
 vinita went and gave the drink  yes sir
you made it
yes sir but i didn't do anything
i don't know how he lost consciousness  
what are you doing with my phone  
deleting my photos
 neha grover right    yes sir
miss neha grover i think you and sudhanshu roy have planned all this together
what sir
 what's the plan    that's how we're going to find out what the plan is
no sir there is no plan here
sir i am still shocked that such a big kidnapping happened in front of you
sir there is no plan i don't know this sudhanshu sir
sir if you are in doubt about the floor i
wait a minute this call is important
hello sir
sheikh what is this joke  
if the kidnapping is over
why are you holding on  
no sir the hijackers are among the people
i can't leave them
first tell me what are you investigating  
a kidnapping   a robbery  
what sir
i asked what are you investigating  
a kidnapping   a robbery  
a kidnapping sir
what kind of kidnapping   that has not happened
the mastermind ran away taking you for a fool
listen i don't want to make a fool of myself in front of everyone
just like you
let it go through you
you can keep their passports
then do your research
do you understand
yes sir what do i say to the media  
tell the media that the three hijackers were killed
flight marshal bhanu yadav is a national hero
ok sir jaya hind sir
what happened sir
nothing your plan was successful
 sir here  you can go
 can i go    yes please
trilok
 take madam out  sir my passport  
 it will be found don't worry  ok sir thank you sir
please take your belongings and come to the main entrance
your passport will be found there
don't talk to me ankit
how did you treat me my head still hurts
stop that nadagama where are the diamonds  
diamonds   to me
 neha  are you crazy  
apart from us only you knew what the diamond box looked like
so i'm not fooling you
neha i know you stole diamonds just tell me how you did it
 oh my god what happened to you  stopping
stop playing this game with me and tell me where the diamonds are
you know i don't think much of anything you say right now
i know you are very angry
neha i am asking you for the last time i am not asking you again and again
 sir   where are you taking him    with us from time to time
sir where are you taking him   sir   sir  
keep going
hurry sir please
all routes are allowed
by means of this first bus to chandigarh
it will then be flown to delhi
you can see the happiness on their faces
sir did that girl know anything  
jinu
nikki
then abbas will be the hijackers
until the plane takes off
no one can know exactly which sit you are in
i really dream of being a flight marshal
vinita go and give this
we can't take real guns on the plane
gaffar bai will make guns for us
the plane has been hijacked
no one is bothered by it
except for someone
so scare them first
collect everyone's phones after the hijack
except for ghaffar
then take control of sudhanshu and his gun
that gun was the one sudhanshu transferred to the unconscious flight marshal before the hijack
it is loaded with fake bullets
then do whatever you want to do with the fake bullets of the real gun
after each movement we change the diamonds
that's all right but why take the plane to the airport  
kullu is a small airport can't control so many people
and it will be easy for sudanshu to take the diamonds out
but why do we bomb  
not a bomb but a chocolate bomb
that will give us an extra twenty minutes
there is a bomb
everyone everyone get out
the three people we hijacked during the bombay riots changed clothes and returned
ma'am if you steal from diamonds let's steal somewhere else
why take this risk of hijacking  
because it's not just about stealing diamonds
one wretch needs to be taught a lesson
i need to change the shape of her face
like never seeing a mirror again
i didn't know you were so strong
we did nothing sir
you have misunderstood
sir call omar sir and ask
leave us alone the truth is we did nothing sir
did your father send you this  
who sent you this  
i don't know that
but i know that someone will take revenge on you
vegetarians can eat apples right  
i loved seeing you like this
you caught me stealing diamonds didn't you  
or they don't even look at girls like me
but now who is looking at your face  
did you play with me
i was playing with you
i was not going to come back to work like this
but you did such a thing
wow neha ji maru
i thought you did these things to me because of the diamond
but revenge
will we meet again  
you are in love
it will be great fun
see you again  
madam your champagne  
 thank you  a trifle
hello

raghubir g

and
good
arjun we are going live in seconds 543
i am arjun paat you are watching this barossa 24/7
the side saw is true
today our land one terrorist left the forest
today i have a special reveal
talked to that terrorist and blew up that clink
raghubir ji   can you hear me
see you
raghubir ji for the sake of the viewers and the country i would like to ask you
why did you blow up this c link  
because it was made by us
the clink   did you make it  
like the rest of the country twenty years ago
i also wanted to feed my family
to send the children to school i did all the jobs for that
these roads were built bridges were built buildings were built
i also wanted to protect my family by doing all that work
did you work on the bridge in 2000  
yes two years ago the bridge had to be maintained
we were told that a very big program is going on in the city
even big people go through clink
so they thought it was old and broken and said they needed maintenance
a two or three year program   the i3 summit   india investment summit  
heavy rain
there was a storm
we didn't even have lifesaving equipment
we said it was dangerous
to stop but they told me to work all night
they asked me to work and if i finished the work quickly i would be given rs 1000 more
millions of dollars are spent in this country for ads on the tv which shows the progress of the country
but look at us twenty years later
we risked our lives for a thousand rupees
to repair that bridge
i understand your pain
arjun slow down a bit and weigh the emotions
you take your time
one rope broke that day
three of my best friends fell into the water
what happened later    
they fell into the water but remained safe
i tried hard to save them
no one came to save them because they all went to meet the big boss
all three of them died like that for those thousand rupees
for one thousand rupees just like yours for the cost of one meal
tell me if i'm wrong
they did not receive any compensation for their lives
there was no intervention from the government
they didn't even look into their family
we are also people of this country
we are also people of this country
you had a bomb on clink
if you want people to pay attention to your story
i will give you a chance through our channel
my name is raghubir mata
i have a family too
i also wanted to be happy
i worked a lot for the country
but the people of this country like us
dogs were treated like dogs even though they were worked to death
do you understand what i'm trying to say    
yes i understand
do you understand  yes
then talk to patal
patal   what colors
call mp jayadev patal
hurry up
councilor jaydev patal  
this program is his responsibility
i want all the workers of our country to get the respect they deserve
he should come in front of the tv and apologize
from the families of those three workers
then all the workers of this country will have hope
look raghubir ji i understand you
but i don't think mps will come here
why can't you come   is that wrong  
see see understand what i'm saying
and
i cannot fulfill all your requests
so shall i tell you how you tipped me off  
i am  
yes you said that  
what's going on
 arjun  you said it yourself

amish dionar
sir i told him
hurry up  but he doesn't ask
while he answers the call i have a question for you
you said that you worked in construction for 30 years
really a worker  
why what do you think   did you think we were stupid because we worked in buildings  
if he doesn't pick up the call don't call
we get angry too
i don't know how my voice will reach the people
but i understand it now see if the phone is ready  
see we keep trying
until i get an answer from him i have one more question to ask
if what you say is true
it is important to compensate those three workers
they got their compensation of 2100000 rupees
yes i am talking amish dionar patil ji's pa
aamir dionar ji i am talking arjun paat from barosa tv   do you see me
yes see
so you know about the terrorist's request  
yes
you probably know this too we only have five minutes left where is mp  
look it can't be said for security reasons
we don't have time to talk about all this amir ji
you see innocent lives are at stake
yes i am telling you that i do not have any official statement about it
look if those people get in trouble because of the government's agenda
people will not forgive you
i am praveen kamat from counter terrorism unit
you go out i will take care of this
are you listening  yes i will try my best
again i say to our viewers
there was a terrorist attack on our country
arjun asked the boss to say something the rating increased by only 50%
he has to come
yes raghubir ji he has to come but we have very less time
it is useless to answer all the terrorist's questions
i am praveen kamat from counter terrorism unit
there are three minutes
wait a minute we need more time
but don't be afraid i'm here
do as i say
now terroristdon't use the word terrorist too muchit can be a problem
show bridge status
raghubir g if you see these scenes
you see that ten people are stuck on the bridge
do you think you can send your message to the community this way  
if you don't do this today will you talk to me   never
so what is wrong with these innocent people   are they also trying to kill  
like those three workers died that day  
do not say that
nothing will happen to those innocent people
i will not let anything happen i just want an apology
put the status of sealink again
let's look again at the status of clink
we are on clink
the first explosion occurred here at 9:34 am
then it happened now
sorry
hey wait a minute be careful
brother brother don't open your hand
put one wheel out right  
you catch me with this offer nothing will happen
children listen to this don't be afraid and don't cry
i'm coming to get you
can't come this way  
sunroof sunroof
and
open the sunroof
listen to what i am saying send the child out through the sun roof
be careful don't let it slip
please do not open this
i will go up to the car and get the child
good
hold on hold on
wait guys
get it fast get it fast
do not let the vehicle move do not cry
father  father is coming
someone catch him
he will be sad to see this
talk a little about that family
talk about that kid
raghubir g one child lost his father today because of you
i remember you said you have a family too
if you had a family too after seeing this
you might feel a little pity
the government should have compassion
there is only one minute left
don't look at it ask him that this is how he wants forgiveness  
is this how you want forgiveness   do you have no other choice  
what are the ways  
in our country laws have been made in the court for the welfare of people like you
do you think they are true  
it is ok for rich and big people
people like us don't have those rules
i'm telling you i thought a lot and i have no other option
but those poor people   it's not their fault
do they want to die  
if you give us some time we can get your forgiveness
i'll give you ten more minutes
it will all be over
just wait wait a minute tell him that the minister will come in five minutes
wait raghubir g  it will all be over
raghubir ji wait mp is coming here
what
we just heard that the minister's car was parked in our park
in a little while he will be here  don't tell lies
i'm telling the truth mp's car came to our park
he will be here shortly
i'm telling the truth mantri ji is with us
you will get the forgiveness you ask for
raghubiraji is finally going to get the forgiveness he wants
i want to thank govt
i want to thank the mp for coming to our room
i will keep my promise yield
he actually enters our studio he opens the door and comes inside
our guest came to our room
this is another commendable effort of our government
hope raghubir ji you will understand this effort
mantri g's director has joined us today
come to make a false apology
raghubir ji mathur ji is in charge of your case
please accept this as a valid apology
can i talk
and sir
sir the camera is here  namaskar
namaskar
i represent the mp subhash mathur
look the government is trying hard to solve this
but our biggest responsibility is to save no one's life
so  
so surrender you have to surrender anyway
go go
look i didn't talk to you harshly  i told you to go
we need five minutes to trace the call
look we'll find you anyway this is your last chance
you can't catch me
you will catch on very quickly why risk your life  
if someone's life is at stake it's yours
see raghubir  sir please
a color will take care of that
miss mathur if you ask me to surrender
we are not getting anything from what we are doing
don't disturb the color i don't talk to terrorists
sir please don't say anything  shut up too
terrorist say

forget all talk shut up and surrender
i don't want stories i want an apology
look at the people at clink
his life is in danger
if you pity these lives stop them

what color are you reading  
our government is publicly apologizing for this kind of shit
how    who said shit  
who was called a scumbag  
am i shit  raghubir g calm down
am i a scum who worked for the government for 20 years  
shut up corrupt man corrupt government
how long has that case been closed   everything was spent by the government
hey what are you thinking   do people know nothing  
i don't need assurances from a terrorist
hey i'm not a terrorist
what do you think do people know nothing   people know everything
oh i'm not the first person to receive such accusations this color is also available
miss mathur do the work you came for
raghubir g don't count his stories please calm down
why are you helping him  
terrorists do not understand even if they say it with love
it is really because of the attitudes of people like you
terrorists like them are more interested

thank you
hello    mantri g is coming isn't he  
yes he is on his way
look at that bridge it hasn't been there for a long time
since when   hurry hurry
yes it will come soon still coming
shall we begin  
do you like
one minute
hello parveen g  
yes arjun
where is mp  
he's coming
yes sir
please don't lie to me
arjun shall we begin  
if you had complained before this happened we would have caught it by now
we will save you anyway
if you don't do your job properly
you are telling me my mistakes
i understand that you don't trust the police but what do you see   you are live
what if something happens to you  
it means we have defeated the terrorists
so how do you catch him  
it will take some time to trace the call
how do you catch him  
calm down
save your energy
he keeps changing his ip address
but we separated 56 towers by tracing the call
it will take three hours
three hours  
arjun we don't have time  i'm very sorry
we have to go on air
call me when you're on the air i will send my number
what time will the mp come  
i said it will come it will come it's true
the liar
what's going on
arjun stop wasting time with it he is playing with you
we are starting to broadcast now
you tell raghubir that you will not apologize
that said    just say no sorry
in capital letters
he wants to see it clearly  what is the boss reading  
what are you reading and what are you reading  
do you really think jaydev patal will come here and say sorry  
did you apologize to soumya   no
do you know why   apologizing means admitting a mistake
nobody wants to do that
if raghubir is caught now if mantri does not apologize
he cannot face the people
so if raghubir does something stupid he becomes the villain
he doesn't want to say sorry to anyone a good ending
can you hear me you have to say this
the channel wants you to read this
arjun you want your news job back don't you  
you have to say this
jay jay unmute that news
we now know
among those who have died so far is a 39yearold father
the person who died after falling off the bridge with the car
and the second subhash mathur representing patilji
according to the information received so far except those who fell down with the car and died
no deaths were reported from the blast
he studies in a government university right  
all my life i have to ask that i am the son of a murderer
i am not a murderer i didn't kill anyone for no reason
jay jay send it back
repost that video
i am not a murderer
i didn't kill anyone for no reason
pravin g  
he never killed anyone without reason
that said  
from 9:00 to 10:00 people will not come because the clink is being developed
he blew it up because the group wouldn't come
see that clink  
forget the story of the five towers
trace the path near the clink raghubir will meet you
wait and see
he does his job you do yours
you ate for a long time
i told you until raghubir became a villain
he can't be caught
you do your job what is our plan  
tell that raghubir
say that there will be no forgiveness
then raghubir does something stupid and becomes a villain
then the police will catch him
then you stop this show
like you helped catch him
live on our channel
what more do you need for an emotional ending  
just like you thought
arjun your information seems correct
we are still looking for him we will catch him soon
sorry  carry on
we need more time mantri ji will come
will apologize  we can't take any more time  as i speak
no no sir
we need more time
we want to catch the terrorist  you hurry up
please hurry  sir wait a minute

i will hand it over to you soon
what are you waiting for   you are alive
take it back
who gives water  
raghubir ji  
yes  
the government is ready to apologize to you
the government is ready to apologize to you
but on one condition
what is it
i am fine
the government wants you to do no more destruction
they want reassurance that you won't do any more damage
the government wants the mp to apologize to you
you come to the studio we will take your forgiveness
best wishes for your future arjun
if i get in front of the camera will everything be alright  
yes it definitely will
well i surrender
yes raghubir g
the government wants you not to explode again
and do no more destruction
but who can guarantee that i will not be cheated again
you come to the room mantri apologized to you in the cabin
with you  yes with me
does that mean i will be forgiven when i come to the studio  
yes it definitely will
no no no
i don't trust you how can i trust you  
how do you say   did you say that you believe me  
that's why you call me  how can you be trusted  
you also took a bribe didn't you  
a bribe    yes
see what the news is saying   are they true  
what are you saying what's wrong  
did you see the news  
i am manas sethi for inl news
miss arjun patak we got to know something about you through our reliable sources
i'd like to ask you a question live
i don't want to answer you
my first question
how long have you been working as a news anchor  
answer
answer my question
reply arjun g
five years
five years and two months
then you remove it
to a radio announcer
that is wrong information i also signed
according to our sources during your 62month announcer lifetime
you took a bribe to hide a very important news
is it right    who said that  
we cannot say that
i said that too
i can save you even now if you tell us what you want
if raghubir cannot be caught you will be caught
your choice
read it
raghubir g think of the people stuck on the bridge
their lives are in danger
the bridge can collapse at any time
did you take a bribe  
in october last year you were awarded as the best announcer
then a report received an award
i heard that the report is from your lady soumya mehera patak
so he is going to divorce you
did you steal soumya's record  
i don't like answering meaningless questions
i can still save you
i will tell soumya that i also asked you to steal her report
arjun if you want to go big you have to achieve
this is life i would do that if i were you
look we'll give you a chance to talk
please answer the questions
i will answer you manas sethi
when people lie and make fools of themselves to increase their ratings it is called fraud
because you think people are stupid  
don't they understand anything   i will answer you
all this is not true
i have a question to ask you
why didn't you tell the police when you said the clink was going to blow up  
asif told this story to miss the producer of your aaj ka topic program
look at these
that means one news anchor
he took bribes and hid important information
a record of his wife was stolen
give today's breaking news
the police were not informed about a terrorist attack
do you have anything to say about it  
see the rating
miss color your silence answered us
and would like to tell our viewers
miss arjun took a bribe and hid the information
about the death of those three workers
stay tuned with inl
i am manas sethi for inl news
share your thoughts with the hashtag #corruptanchor
the rating was 70%
let's talk if we ever meet
forget about the news you are always a radio announcer
bisht tell the driver to take the car
if only one channel had talked about those three workers then this would not have happened
raghubir ji i want to help you
i forgive you  you are not worth keeping
you are all the same that's the end of today's news
wait wait
what do you know about the news business  
not every news you see is true
because it takes time to find the truth those who watch the time don't have it
people have a control just like you have a bomb control the remote
every news channel is afraid that it is you
people want drama channels want ratings
nobody wants the truth
i don't take revenge raghubir ji
i did what the news channel told me to do
raghubir ji i too am a puppet of a system like you
today i have been requested by the channels because i am helping you
i tried to get your forgiveness
trust me raghubir ji whatever i say is true
the mp will come won't he  
will definitely come
everything will be fine then
well done arjun
let's go live
coming alive 543
raghubiri g i have a message
you may not see this but this is a message from the police

why come to the other studio why not come there  
he will come soon he just came here  he will apologize won't he  
yes you will be forgiven  arjun

then everything will be fine
raghubir g the lives of people still in clink are in danger
our reporter soumya mehra is waiting there
soumya ji can you hear me  
yes i hear arjun ji
still 12 lives are in danger here
he is very injured in pain and afraid
they need treatment as soon as possible
due to the explosion this bridge can break at any time due to the explosion
this bridge is moving
we really don't have time
the situation continues to worsen
the rescue team has arrived
you can see that a rescue helicopter has arrived here
but until raghubir ji gives permission we cannot do anything
due to technical reasons soumya mehra patak's connection was lost
raghubir g life in danger on clink
please at least women and children  don't jump out of the story
let only women and children go
if i don't receive my forgiveness all will die all will die
raghubir ji we are trying our best to bring the mp here and get your apology
but if something happens to someone in the meantimeif a life is lost all this will go down the drain
at least you let the women and children go
because they are innocent people they have not done anything

# from helmet 2021 hindi websrt
india is a very different country
different cultures languages traditions
do you know why  
because of the population here
this is the most populous country in the world
the population here is increasing just like a beautiful girl's instagram followers are increasing
but we have been trying to control it for six years
how many std awareness programs have we done  
all over the country
we played more than 400 street plays with universities like du jnu bhu
but on the contrary    
the opposite is zero
the demand for condoms is not increasing
what do you think why is there no demand for this    
sir why don't you give these to someone for free  
once in lakshmi we went from house to house and tried to give them away
no one took it
instead they gave me sandals
one of them said is this what mothers and fathers have taught you  
do a little important job he said
he drove away sir
he is right sir
my mom caught some condom in my bag and yelled at me
he sat in a corner crying for two hours
he cried as if there was a bomb in my bag
this is the mindset we need to change
there is one good news
we have now received the support of the ministry of health
per survey
what's the good news sir  
we do door to door surveys
people are openly asked about condoms
all information about it is required
just like in the census
sirsir
can you tell us to go door to door and ask  
do you use condoms  
no sir oh sir
oh yes sir
sir this is not practical
really  
do you remember our policies bharat  
if you can't do it then don't ask questions about it
right  
and sir
for this work we form separate groups and go to different cities

you could not bring even one when you wanted
and now these stocks are out
this is a new company it's called helmet
 helmet    o
what kind of company is that  
a very big company this is what is being sold
they sell to us and we sell to them
do you have a lot of commissions lucky    hmm
didn't you find some important work  
she
was this how you were thinking of making money  
rupali
i did it no matter what i said
because this sultan said
look rupali i will explain
but minus told me too
tell me
we stopped a czech cart truck
 let's drink something  truck  
look i want to sell rupali
find money
good or bad that's it
what to do with selling something like this  
looking for money
how much money do you earn  
we need millions we have millions
millions of condoms  
are they made of gold  
no no sir it is made of rubber
is it  
who stopped you  
who are they
one sir is a constable
there was another commissioner sir
commissioner sir  
our commissioner sir  
yes they check if there are bombs
where are the bombs going  
are you still in the 70s  
 have you been drunk    no sir
he doesn't drink no right  
 not  oh no sir
what's their face like  
like
commissioner sir was in the hammer
then constable is like antana kanuwa
and sir they are rich
did you say rich  
those guys who said they have a bungalow a car and a lot of money
where did the posting come from  
sir from delhi
i also applied
unfortunately for me
anyway
that man can draw
adevi as you say
 hello  all details must be given exactly
right  
ok
also tell him not to throw dirt like that if they didn't tell him
good sir
because he is used to it
he has been drawing pictures of hooligans for 30 years
now he's used to it and stains every image
tell me this how many boxes did you pick up  
so much  
we needed money fast
the company was sold to us for half the price
so we bought the goods
how much have you sold so far  
that is the problem
no one buys these
everyone is embarrassed
this is not easy
being ashamed to ask for condoms from the pharmacy is a national problem
hmm
no one understands the seriousness of it
but i try
there is only one way to do everything
why did you throw it away  
see they have only one problem
everyone wants it but is too shy to ask for it
that's true
minus' father wanted it
that too at this age
do you want to take it away and do something else my father  
really  
oh yeah
your
 oh lucky  you
this this look at this how to sell condoms  
earning money and getting married is like a dream
 you are the one who provoked me  sultan
damn the mouth of the mouth the mouth of the mouth
 let go bro  sultan
if rupali is not there i will kill two very good ones for nileka
 stop jacob  can you tell me  
did you take the bait  
 acting like a dog in front of a girl    this pig
you still look like a little one so will that litter grow up  
tell him to shut up
my lousy father
stop it
my father needs condoms at this age too
that's what it means
his father wanted condoms at this age too
come to think of it everyone needs a condom
but they are shy and afraid
because the seller knows him
i don't understand what to do with the father sent and taken away  
minus
he also does what causes the population to increase here
understand
but if we try we can help reduce it
we do that by selling these
but not for pharmacies
directly to the people
but why do people buy them from us  
because we sell it cheap wearing a helmet
the seller neither knows nor feels fear
the idea is good lucky
but who do we start with first  
we will find someone soon
even if you work for twelve hours not even twelve customers will come to you
but if you come home and make noise you know better
those who work all day take care of these children too
not only that i have to shout at you
don't always catch the children and tell them wrong
better to say without  
this devil made my life hell
people tell me that children are generators
 oh you get out of here  i am going
let's go kids
go go home
i will understand when i have to take care of them
the tea is cold
you have to listen to this every day
sometimes with a razor
i feel like cutting my neck
who the hell are you  
what will happen   show your face
can't show face
it is a rule of our company
hmm
but i know how your life goes
how do you know about my family life  
nothing will happen if the neck is cut
the problem is that it needs to be cut not you
it seems that there is no love between you and your sisterinlaw
he was just like a litter generator
who are you  
a god
huh  
did you say that  
the savior
please i came to help you
nothing happened between you and your sisterinlaw recently right  
it is because of its mentality
put it out without being tight
that said  
that said i have the answer to the question
 what is this    yako arakane
this will bring back happiness in your life
try using it
hamine will not get pregnant again
i will give you one for 130 and sixty
big time work don't you understand that  
long packets  
oh no long is a long time
use it and see where it is
keep
give me money later
crashing and ending
 what is doing    what happened  
take hand let me stay
please let me do it
we have been fighting for so long

a deity maine
kama sutras
even if you sell five packets per couple

i can't give it to them

 hello  hello lucky
 oh    listen there is one question
the marriage was rushed for four months
what are you reading hello
i told you to postpone for six
two more months for that
 hurry up  i tried
but not with that donkey
i am friends with a boy
i'm really sorry
no no no
i also have girlfriends in new york
i am not a virgin
twenty or thirty times that work was done with it
i like people with experience
i am pregnant
the visa is valid for another four months
let's get married soon
then that child will be born in new york let's take american citizenship
that is death
oh dear rupali
how can i earn a lot of money in four months  
lucky lucky i will try too
i will also sell them
where do you sell  
oh children you have nothing
tell me
we are not selling makeup products
how are you planning to sell  
i will take care
i will take it later
mom i am thinking about my married life
what happens after marriage  
what to do how do you do
 i don't even know anything  what don't you know  
he was in love with singing that song
but you don't know what to do after marriage
wow
but mom loving is something else
this is also something different
so i haven't done it to know that
it will be at that time sir
look at me
he got married at the age of 17
he was hiding
mom found me and said
go get married
it hides in the clay where it cannot be found
i'm not talking about that
i said i was young in those days
i didn't know anything like this
i found out everything when i got married
now there are two children who are afraid of meeting the third one
why are you afraid  
there are options for that
use them
are you raising children without thinking about the future  
look at me
there is such a big house
there is every comfort in every way
but found one child that's enough
after that no more
but mom don't let them find those options
and it's going to be profitable
then why are they not using it  
why nammu  
what else  
where do the poor get the money to spend on it  
ah the cost of having children is better than the cost of buying it
came here to brag
all of the vegetables that were brought here were bugs
clean up now
hmm
listen
there is an option to get those kids to disappear
i have them
that said  
give me a hand
oh big sister when asked she said she didn't know anything
now if you ask the big madam
he used it before
try it yourself
listen
i will give you a packet of eighty for forty
you sell it for sixty
think
one packet earns twenty rupees
if you sell ten a day you will earn 200
maybe even more

let's go to the police
police  
 rupali beauty beauty  stop 
the police can't go
 oh no  no can't
why  
why can't you go  
there has been a theft
so where else to go without going to the police  
but what do you say to the police   does that mean we brought this to sell  
how embarrassing   chi chi
if you don't tell the police how will they know where it is  
will someone call and say  
come we have your goods come and take them away
 your phone is ringing  and
who doesn't know
 let's find another solution  hello
where did your boxes go  
i came to your farm
ask to take two or three chickens
but after seeing these boxes i brought them all together
now if you want the boxes come and take the boxes with my money
do you understand
yes
yes bunty brother
who is bunty now  
someone asked me for a loan to start a chicken farm
what did you say
if the money is not paid by this evening all the boxes will be sold

hmm  
didn't you tell me that all the boxes were sold  
they became millionaires
chicken king sultan
i have to feed your chickens too
pressed into the mouth
a thief is number one
oh mr bunty we were selling these to pay off your debt
what is this then  
nothing bunty brother
one company gave us some goods at wholesale price
less than half the price
we sell them and make a small profit
a little bit  
do not find a large amount
but after giving my money
but bunty brother if you don't give this back to us what are we going to sell  
how do you find money  
you won't even have to pay off your debt
do this and take four boxes
sell them
after giving me that money
take four more boxes
sell ​​it again and give me the money
you have to keep doing that until you get all my money
 one thing you say is bunty brother  it's your wish
 it's very easy  get four boxes quickly
 hey stand up  let's go
remove the boxes from the floor
oh why are you bothering  
yes from you
you didn't tell us this
 what    what is in these boxes  
why are you looking at each other  
what's in the box  
 biscuits  chips
oh my god are they selling marijuana in my area

nononono chotu

chotu malli chotu malli
 chotu malli  chotu malli
brother bunty that is a new company's helmet
they gave us wholesale price
we also needed money
we couldn't think of anything so we bought it
sorry
mother child
where did you get these until now  
rarely in some places
take the boxes and come with me
 oh sorry bunty  oh sorry bunty brother
 sorry bunty brother  oh bunty brother
how are you aunty
how are you bunty
what is this place
how do i know
tell me you know mr bunty
dear sister
 how are your    what are you looking at  
get it here
please don't count that
what do you mean  
a poster about rogue cop ralahamila  
 is that chotu    oh  
 it's like you're used to seeing it isn't it    yes seen somewhere
how long have you both been wearing helmets  
 no i put it on because it's very cold  it's very cold
why are you sweating  
that happy sweat
happy sweat asked today
go
oh mr bunty you have come to the wrong place
there are children here
did you come for the first time  
 o  yes we have never been
how do you live  
meal time
why did we come here mr bunty  
some children are learning english
 looks like we're going to be very uncomfortable  rani  
did she see bunty as a matter of business  
finish it and come out soon
can you bother him  
is that yours  
what's up bunty  
did you think it was a shop  
 hello sister  huh    not
hmm
so don't shout
came to work
chotu
one is 130
i will give it to sixty
best quality available
take
how much have you changed  
 girl  and
 when we asked them to use these  what happened  
then what did you say  
then there is no character
now we are told to take this
what is that
i am enjoying the results now
i have a disease that can never be cured
so rani i have to be careful with pinna now
you must have learned a lesson because that happened to you
what about the others  
one does not like to use
we have to sin
your illness and your children
we are the ones who suffer
lady rani that's why we came here
with hope
finish all this
now think
if this happens what will happen to the future of these children  
um  
you heard me
come to a definite decision
if everyone wants to work from you why can't you just do this for yourself  
this is true
if you don't listen even after being told twice
don't leave even if you come thirty times waiting for something from you
humanity tells you
because he comes here for his needs
then it is your need to use it
no matter what society tells you
this kind of security is because of you
you don't know your own strength
practice reciprocity
will go
um  
will you pay for fifty  
i will take five packets
50   50  
 haha  ha
 four packets for me too  give me ten packets too and then i will give money
no problem
 chotu    yes
they want to share a bit
you can't get the money later
then it is yours to sell helmets here
 and bunty bai  what is this helmet  
a helmet company
take the goods there
they give us and we sell helmets
a big company  
 yes very big  a very big one
take my brother too he is also looking for a job
very wise too
he also went to college take a look
alas many people do not have jobs in this city
not all helmets can be sold
waiter
why didn't you come earlier  
get me a packet of milk and remind me every now and then and bring a pipe
but it should be cold
otherwise it has no quality
what are you reading  
milk packets are not sold here
and don't get me waiter waiter do you understand
there is no one to take over the job of waiter mr waiter
poverty makes us capable of doing anything
i was also very poor at that time
but now i have some money
how do you ask that  
how  
because of kamasutra
do you know kamasutra  
you are very rude
see a psychiatrist
yes
when you are poor you become crazy
oh how long have you been waiting for you to come
how many times did you call   what are you talking about  
five times
you didn't hear me don't blame me
that's why it was late
what do you mean to me  
it was july that stopped me
why is this so happy  
because sultan used a condom for the first time in his life today
good luck
but it's true
i am not that person
i have experience now
kudos to julie
what are you doing  
sultan  
how do you get someone to work without sounding like a girl  
sell ​​helmets
that is not the problem
the question is will a man like it  
why don't you like it  
we give you money
the story is right
but they don't understand that they don't have a job when they spend the whole day on the internet
yes
lucky
we need to make them understand that they don't have a job
of course
besides it is good to do work that earns money by going up and down all day
without
i saw a poster in front of the public toilet
there were two people in it
those pictures are very ugly
they have stolen goods from a truck
shall we hand them over to the police and get the gift  
do you know the meaning of that  
hmm
their artist cannot draw
yako said that everyone is reading these posters
oh
you have now arrived at your destination
did you come to the interview  
 welcome  who are you  
it wasn't hard to find the place was it  
no sir it was not very difficult
then it's okay
this   what is this sir
our product
never used it  
i think it might be that person
one is 130 and we give it for sixty
you sold for eighty to ninety
you keep the profit
but why are you selling this  
i said something of yours without even a branch
all this is there
when a branch is sold who buys it guys
that is why our company is trying to sell in a different way
wearing a helmet
i say join us
look malayo everyone needs food clothes helmets
but the difference is that you don't need anything to use it
 right    is that sultan  
 will this do it    is that sultan your name  
nonono
sultan bajrangi bhaijana dabangg
 munni  not so famous
we are all fans of salman khan
brother give me one helmet

lucky brass band
i was also thinking that how did they meet so much  
start a big band like this
you must be surprised too
i will tell you how you met
a truck has been stolen
lucky and his mischievous friends
that chickensmelling boy and that deafening beer
do you know what was in the truck  
gold silver textiles
not
there were condoms in it
condoms  
along with selling more of these craps
then what did you say to her  
helmet
sold wearing a helmet
what else can you expect from them  
what else can these bastards do without stealing  
what else to do without stealing  
and the honor of this city is being destroyed
take it mr ralahami
let's go
the opening ended with a bang
 let's go  now
why didn't you tell me lucky  
what will you say  
there was no other way to find money
we thought they were stealing phones from the truck
you all know that my parents left me in an orphanage when i was two months old
i don't know there were many children there
we all ate togetherdrankplayed
then every sunday
i brushed my head with powder and oil for a good clean
dressed up in clothes given by other children's parents
went to the orphanage office
i don't know many children found a home but i didn't
i thought that if my parents left me someone else would want me
when i found condoms without mobile phones in the items that were picked up
i remembered the same story
i remembered the children whose eyes were filled with hope
maybe if people used a condom
the number of orphans like me would have decreased in this world
so i thought i'd go ahead and sell this
do something good and find some
but the only problem was that this was a theft
so the thief sold what he stole
it was also punished
the reason i hesitated from within this is
i lied to you
i'm very sorry
a recent news has come from motihar lane in raj nagar
about the biggest condom theft ever happened in the country
yes you heard that right
this is a condom theft
we ask our correspondent kishore for more details on this
yes kishore
yes hello
i am standing in front of helmet gang leader lucky's house in motihar ghat raj nagar
it was lucky who stole a truck with condoms with his friends
they are in prison today
can you tell me how many condoms have been stolen and sold  
are details given about it  
according to sources
they sold only 20000 condoms
only two lakhs have been stolen
yes

we are from the national aids control program ngo
after your arrest we conducted a survey in this district
it was understood that sexually transmitted diseases and abortions were reduced by 80%
and this was possible only because of you three
the government spends millions every year
to awareness and distribution programs about condoms
there are reasons why people are reluctant to buy a condom
feeling afraid and shy to ask
but these programs were not successful
the work you have done is amazing
now you all have to take off your helmets
without any shame or fear
i want to say it out loud
condoms
 condoms  condoms
condoms condoms condoms

it will not be easy for me to do naina in this drama
if not easy go and tell the truth

dad
but secretly
fatherfather
i have something important to tell you father  two hearts
sorry
the party is yours the alcohol is yours and this chicken is yours
so who speaks first  
me too
what do you have to say  
son you are married
although not as tight as mine
a little sunken
tell me one thing son
has anyone heard   not  
why are these ladies so boring after marriage  
father you took the words out of my mouth father
the ladies can even take the food out of their mouths
you are talking about these words
dad you are right
i also wanted to tell you about this topic
ditto
is it    yes
because things related to this marriage are difficult things
very hard son very hard
that is the most beautiful story you told
how to say
this is as difficult as being a vegetarian in a lion's den
a vegetarian lion  
yes son
she won't eat me because she is a vegetarian
but they are afraid and keep the noise on
dad either i'm getting older
or you talk too loud
gaburin is talking son
i mean everything changes after marriage
i am so  i am changing son
nonala is changing
a beautiful butterfly
it's going to be a bargain
a suitor  
yes just the ugliest the ugliest
like becoming a beautiful butterfly
this is the other side of it
since they were butterflies
become a boyfriend
can't say names about dalabu
but these ladies are very boring
sure true sure true
women are like mogambo
mogambola can even make you happy
but these ladies can never be pleased
have you ever heard from a woman's mouth i am happy now  
those people who can't even make santa claus happy
we are people people
a man can go and eat if he wants
or you can be happy
never get both
that means do you know what is the biggest festival in the world  
what the hell  
are they at home  what is that  
because he should be celebrated every now and then
that is why i thought of divorcing your mother
devos
divorce
i am 100% sure and will definitely get divorced
as soon as ginni got married here
i am divorcing your mother
since when were you going to say
a big burden was released
dad

if i am late your mother will scold you
good night  dad
dad dad
is dad running away  
dad
as soon as ginni got married here
i am divorcing your mother
i am 100% sure and will definitely get divorced
son of fire tell me one thing
if ever there is a big problem
so whose side are you on  
dad by your side
the answer is wrong
you are with a farmer
why  
because you have to eat with it
dad let me drink the coffee
before waking up in the morning
you want to delete your whatsapp
hello son
good morning bro

shut your mouth
yes rimpi
meki's first marriage has already happened with the phone

you have to do what my uncle has to do
he says that the dog has sent you a special invitation
he said that the party will not be held if his father does not come
and uncle every young girl is there
you have to stay there
if you open your mouth every day it's nonsense
he said something right for the first time
and thank you kuku
you saved me from your mother's plea
how much your mother begs
i feel afraid that god has come in person
makes a request please stop beating those drums
even the people in that world can't sleep
it doesn't matter

what did you tell me then  
i didn't tell you the truth
mame mame get in the mood

you told me you and mom went to the mansion
then you said to god you want one toy
then he gave me to you

that's the problem of your generation
as soon as you see a girl grab her and jump on the bed
i swear cuckoo
until today i have not touched anyone other than geeta
not even meera
we are in the first step of our relationship
even if he comes to the movie hall and hits a finger he gets a little angry
dad i don't want to hear that
close your mouth for two minutes
please  i gave 30 years to your mother
for our marriage
what did i ask for instead  
a little love a little romance
oh i was thinking of giving up everything
then meera came into my life
he gave me that love and that romance
oh i don't want to hear about your relationship
shut up dad
your mother surrendered
but i want to live
he is not in love i am in love  stop the car

good morning ms emraan hashmi

please tell me nothing happened yesterday
please tell me i had a bad dream
mom and dad you don't seem to understand either
you obviously still love gaurav  
then why on earth are you marrying that dog
because marriage is done in an orderly manner rimpi
like brother and sister
like mom and dad
what will i say if they ask me how much they earn  
still struggling to make ends meet in the music industry
will you be a rockstar  
a message came from the dogs
how was the party

if the problem is having children  
don't want to have children
no one is forcing
mom it's not like that
so what's wrong  
do you want to say something  
both of you   i said
since when did these happen  
marriage is understood as a joke
as soon as there is a small fight there is divos
open a mountain and listen to both of you
let both of you talk
solve whatever the problem is
there has never been a divorce in this house
never will
we have been married for 35 years now
have we never had a fight  
didn't the problems arise  
but it's not that hard
getting divorced after a fight
look son
to save a marriage you have to work hard
have to work
but nowadays you don't want to work hard
are you standing like a lion  
why not say anything  
the truth is your mother
marriage is no joke
you have to work hard to maintain the relationship
i know it's not that easy but
pick up the phone
no no pick it up
what did you say  
what should be done to save the relationship  
tell me father
cuckoo shut up
listen to what mom says
i asked what my mother said

marriage is not a joke
not really
so what is a marriage  
don't be crazy and sit down

no no you decided to play the role of father today
so let's become a father and tell everyone what marriage is

how else to talk to him  
he sits and talks to us about marriage
he also wants to divorce his mother

sit without nonsense
this is not nonsense  sitting
sitting sitting  who is calling  
shut up  tell me whose call is it

meera you want to talk
can you do it now  
there is no point in talking around meera
let's talk directly
we have been married for 35 years
there were many fights
but i never thought that such a day would come
he is not happy with me
and if he is not happy how can i be happy  
that's why i give him to you
you two can get married
i will sign anywhere you say
but be patient until ginni's marriage
mom what are you talking about  
there is something to be said about him
check his sugar every day
eating a lot of sweets will increase your sugar
do not drink too much
stomach upset
don't talk too much until breakfast
getting angry
no matter what you cook for the night
roti should be hot
and yes don't add too much chili
has been operated twice
and most importantly
don't let him worry too much for any reason
recently had a heart attack
if there is any other doubt or problem
ask anytime
but till ginni's wedding be patient
please
and don't worry about me
even when he was there i took care of the family
i will take care without him
let's go naina son
mom are you ok
shall we drink wine  
when he gets drunk he comes with a little left over
otherwise it becomes difficult for him to bear
did you meet cuckoo at school  
in the fifth year
oh god
it took you both a lifetime to understand each other
i met for the first time four days after the wedding
what
yes i have met twice
but just saw
four days after the wedding
after all relatives are gone
and in the first year i thought
that this is not right
but then divorce and separation did not come to mind
then found cuckoo
found fire
make them big save the fights
teach
half of my life was spent for that
we could never be husband and wife
but he was a good mother and father
then the children grew up
everyone went their separate ways
once again we are from mom and dad
became husband and wife
that's when i looked again
then i thought
is this the person i married  
he's not a bad guy naina
he took care of me
but care is the same
there is a difference in showing love
a relationship of several years
it becomes an addiction
so giving up an addiction is very difficult
i am
i don't know if what i am doing is right or wrong
but it is very difficult
mom
mom whatever
i am with you
naina son a relationship does not break for one reason
with a lot of unresolved issues
if you are very tired
if you don't have the strength to move forward
don't think for a minute what people will say
i am with you no matter what decision you take
but if you can give just one chance
you give me son
you both are my children
mom
mom where have you been  
father angrily took the bag and left
what made you want to do all this  
who gives their man  
what did you want to prove  cuckoo  
what mother did  i am talking to mother
what did you want to prove  
why are you talking to naina like that  
never talk like that in front of me
sir  
how much longer do you have to wait  
what is there a meeting  
run away now
and don't come back
surprise surprise
you  how long have i been waiting  
make something soon very hungry bro
what are you doing here
what are you doing here  
i left everything behind forever
meera for you
let's go let's go in come on  just wait
i was going to call you
do you remember me a lot  
not
today after i met geeta
i realized that i could never be like him
it doesn't have to be like that
you are completely different
she is crazy
beam i have always been very independent
changing my life my routine because of someone else
i can't anyway
i understand meera
beam i am not from abarala roti hadanavar
i was always alone
because of that not even a dog was made until today
are you comparing me to the dog  
i can't be with you
mira don't take geeta's story seriously
he 
geeta is a very good person
we are doing him wrong
harbhajan oi harbhajan hitahan
i want to go back home harbhajan  
good night
i don't know what is going on in this house
you should have understood mom
not to support the other side
mom did the right thing by giving her a dikkazade
and i'm with it
what are you trying to say  
is your head bad  
that's my mom and dad
and they both love each other
so don't we love each other  
naina they cannot be separated
why not kuku  
we can separate but they can't
what is the difference between our mind and their mind  
this is not about us
it's really about them
why are you acting all of a sudden  
have you ever sat down and talked with your mother  
did you ask him mom are you okay  
do you have any idea what happened to him now  
his whole life for his marriage   hello why are you preaching to me  
she is my mother i know her
and don't interfere too much
if you can't solve problems at home
don't make too much of a mess bro
god how selfish are you  
have you ever felt
mother is not happy in this marriage  
ever tried to find out  
no  
because it's none of your business
concerns you
just whether you are happy with their decisions or not
you are selfish like your father
don't compare me with my father
you are just like your father  no
yes someone who only cares about his own happiness
because of your selfishness
the same situation happened in our relationship today
because of me
not because of me but because of you
and you are selfish not me
you went to canada because of you
i left my home and my city
if you were where i am no matter where you find the job
aren't i coming with you  
normal couples help each other in these two situations
what help are you reading about haha  
i left my life and came to canada with you
where is the bigger help  
not only the donation there should be a bond too kuku
and you keep blaming me
do you think i'm not hurt  
if anything goes well in my life
i want to tell you first
but can't say
because you will never be happy in my happiness
it's just like feeling guilty in my victory
shut up naina
stop the nonsense  that's true
have you ever said naina i'm proud of you  
and this story will never be told
you do it for love cuckoo
okay so i'll talk about it
but what is the difference  
do you feel anything
do you feel
you knew i was out of breath
but did you do anything  
no your position your job your money
am i making money just for myself  
looking for us
for our future
and don't just say this
i value this job more than you and this family
in the second year of marriage
i said let's make a cuckoo kid
was waiting to drop everything
but you said no
yes i said no
because i didn't have a job
i didn't want to maintain the house with your money
that is your male ego
hey how can that be male ego  
the fact that i wanted to earn money and maintain the house
how is the male ego  
that's what every man in the world wants naina
you say it's my fault i went out and succeeded
the one you couldn't be  
this
this is what you do
you make me understand how big a mouse i am
you didn't miss a single chance to show
show how successful naina sharma is how big a failure kukuo is
yes you are a failure and so am i
look at us cuckoo
i am a failure as a wife you are a failure as a husband
and you know
you are now going to fail as a son
sorry
sorry
father  
father  
dad what are you doing on the road  
sit down sit down
no matter how beautiful our surroundings are
but we never appreciated them
as if it came i didn't appreciate gita in our house  
it is now five in the morning
what happened to you  i was wrong son
i was wrong
you did a great job of meeting meera with geeta
thank you
after listening to his story today i understood
he is the first and the last
i tried to go to meera
however my legs did not go forward
i called him and told him no
he cried a lot
but i was not sensitive
i understood him
gita is my other piece
anyway it was too late
i have one request before going
take care of geeta for me
dad you are not going anywhere
you come home with me
how do you face  
he doesn't accept

mom please say something
i'm not saying he's right
he is wrong
and now he understands that too
just take a look
mom we are one family
so if we don't forgive each other's mistakes
so who else does  
give one last chance
gita made a mistake
lost consciousness
i don't know what you were thinking
because everything was expensive i
i tried to leave everything but
if i left without apologizing to you
sometimes i will never forgive myself
geeta please
you are my family
you these are my children
can't live without you
forgive me for the last time
i'm sorry son
please
i really have to go now
i will go but

mom and dad are there for each other
no  of course bro

ado cuckoo i always thought
between love and lust
that this lust will always win
but no
dad turned my thoughts to the other side
he always hits the other side
he's not daddy
he is a transformer
i have an idea
say  well this victory of ours will not be complete
as long as we don't insult that madam rangili

there is no marriage

not even your parents

# from mindcage2022websrt
jake
dutch
hey you're not going to like this jake
believe me
do not examine the corpse
until the chief inspector gets here
realized but you are half an hour late
the priest said that he had never seen this woman in the church
just because he's a priest doesn't mean he can't lie mary
sage
jake
stay here
i already spoke with dr loesch
the artist is right where he should be
wait for the csi to finish their report (csi=crime scene investigator)
no conclusions can be reached yet
what are you talking about  
about an old demon
called again today from st joseph
the doctors give him a week two weeks at the most
you go see him
 i can't stand it  mary this is your father
can we please stop talking about this  
before the god of the bible created the world
he created the heavens
in heaven he created angels
and angels and archangels
archangels are angels of high status
and they are messengers of god
among these angels was lucifer
both women were smeared with resin
the lab confirmed that it was the same used on the previous victims
past victims  
i think this time we have someone who works like someone before
sir  
a person who has good knowledge about his pioneer
 excuse me sheriff    that's inspector kelly
i didn't know there were other cases related to this
i thought jake might have said
i must have missed it
ok here's how the cliff notes say it
five years ago the serial killer arnold lefebvre
or the artist kidnapped and murdered six women
prostitutes sex brokers
at first he poisons then they are preserved with a liquid made from castor seeds
then he decorates the corpses
using underwater frames like living statues
they are all over the city for anyone to find
he calls them his great works
i really remember that it was before the final exam
so i forgot some details
how did you catch him  
good detective work
made by the best testers one of which is right next to you
hey would you like to relax with a coffee  
it's the only thing that keeps me going
lately even sleep has not given me much rest
ah a railway worker found him about an hour ago
have to take some pictures here
the people of the city are still trying to come to terms with what happened five years ago
all we need now is a copycat's nightmare
sir you preach to the choir
yes that's why i look at everything
 can't be can't be for how long  think about it jake
he's our best chance and you know it
 nobody does this sir  dutch has already volunteered
 dutch    okay sorry voluntary for what  
the artist
he wants to send dutch to see the artist
ok it's a lot of work but it's worth a try
i think if you see his arrogance
he will back off when he sees someone copying his work
but i think dutch needs a subtle strategy
i will send someone else
who are you thinking of inspector  
you are looking at him
my background is in psychology so
i read your file mary
so what do you say   you won't regret this
sir he is not ready for this
do you know something i'm really good at making individual decisions
thank you i won't let you down
i will tell dr loesch to make arrangements this evening
thank you
i still deserve to be here
so don't try to take full ownership of the chat
i also have a few questions
everything really i'm not coming with you
what are you saying
the artist plays the way we want
only if we win his trust
if i'm in that room it's hard to do because of our history
what are you saying except being arrested   or
people will remember the artist for the six women he killed and saved
but he actually took seven lives
what are you saying
zach anderson my partner for 15 years
a good friend
the day we captured the artist sake was killed
jake i'm sorry i i had no idea
there's more
that night we chased the artist in a police car
we were hit our vehicles overturned
i might lose consciousness for a while
because i don't remember sake going out
i saw him standing in front of the artist
so  
sake poured kerosene on his body and set himself on fire
mr lefebvre is constantly observing
he is actually the only resident of the mental institution
to be killed
the court decided that he was not insane  
yes i read his medical evaluation on the day of court
 don't you agree    i don't care
transfer the artist and don't bother him here
make trouble for yourself  
cut off his hand
he paints on the walls with his own blood
thank you
mr lefebvre my name is inspector mary kelly
i know who you are
sorry did someone say i was coming  
yes a friend with wings told me
ok i'm sure someone like you will use the time well
rather than talking to birds
who talked about a bird  
the reason i came today is actually
undoubtedly about the copycat
i hope you wish to pick my brain about it
yes i am
i was hoping you would see a parallel in the story
if you have seen pictures of the victims
maybe you see something that can help us
if i saw something what would i get out of it  
i thought someone like you
would not like to lose reputation as a copycat
that's a great story mary
tell me i'm sorry you have to come with me another way
okay then i'll talk to dr losch
i'll see if you can get good meals
two weeks until my hangover do you think i'd like a new meal  
so an increase in time out  
i am not a person who likes to work hard
no again
but let's get straight to the point shall we  
i want my death sentence commuted to life imprisonment
sorry to say i don't have the power to do that
you will get power if we show something to the relevant authorities
show  
pictures of my most outrageous artworks are still on the internet
if someone who knows someone looks at it then they can copy my work
so the suspect can be anyone
not just anyone
this preserve fits right in
your composition is sealed by the court
it was never made public so this copycat
he knows more than that
maybe it's someone you've known in the past
someone you trusted  
can you give me the file tonight  
i like to study well
i'll tell dr losch to put you in the cage
meanwhile i made some questions
refresh your memory
it won't be necessary my memory is vivid
but i would like your help
 what is that    my art supplies
they have been with the sheriff's department since i was arrested
i want them with permission to use them in my cage
it is imperative that i get my art supplies mary or nothing can be done
it's a must
remember my deathbed is coming soon
thank you mary
i'll see what i can do
if you come across anything dr losch will be available over the phone
mary have you heard of the angel samuel  
yes but i don't listen to fairy tales
then he comes mary
he knew i was coming
someone inside gives him information
what about our case   does he want to help  
what does he want  
he wants to change the verdict
 no time  okay he might know something
don't be naive mary
 he only said what you wanted to hear  childish   wow
 it doesn't fit  i'm very sorry
but in two weeks that thief will be over
the world will be a better place
i think we should both have coffee
no problem thank you
sir move away from the vehicle
i am asking you again
 unlocking    okay sorry
thank you
no fingerprints no dna
same as five years ago
yes what  
tell dr losch that he needs to speak to inspector kelly
you have two minutes
did you see the tattoo on his left shoulder  
church of satan emblem  
on the other side an inverted pentagon with a goat's head in the middle
it says sexism i think
do you know about those things  
i know about piper
it was a brothel five minutes' walk from where the body was found
every woman who works there has a tattoo like this
he's a whore mary
inspector kelly
thank you very much mary for bringing me my old pictures
appreciate it a lot
 prove it  i will
but first i want to clarify something
whatever help i give it's for you and you alone
your police friends are not for anyone else did you understand  
realized
now the copycat's last victim the victim
do you know if the coroner cut off his limbs  
what's the point  
because he needs them
why does he need them  
mr lefebvre why does he need wings  
to the journey of his afterlife
forgot something  
yes i want to look at the branches
 what did he say    something about branches
he says they are important for something
there is something in this i think it's stuck
what the hell is this
this is a nail paint brush
this color was discontinued years ago
can you tell by looking at this  
not this is the color i used in high school
my father objected to these
i have to move this okay  
that brush was in it sir
can you confirm this  
still wondering about the coroner
mr reid   what about him
are you aware that he is in a relationship with the artist  
if only he had known that he had these brushes
if nothing had been said about it  
why would he do something like that jake  
i have known dr reed for five years
i guess
it is important to continue to receive information from the artist
i honestly think we should consider commuting his sentence
we need more than just a brush
get permission from the governor inspector
but if you feel something keep going
you will get the help you need
what will happen if we try to catch the copycat hoping to kill both of them  
hey can i ask something  
what exactly happened the day the artist was arrested  
jake and zeek jumped after him at high speed and jake lost control
they collided
the vehicle caught fire jake jumped out sikh died on the spot
jake suffered burns to his left arm but was arrested anyway
hello jacob
i expected a good handshake
i'll shake hands with the devil instead
be careful with your wishes
do you realize how crazy you are  
this is a very wrong idea jacob
especially as someone who has seen what you have seen
it's sad really i'm content with one thing
not only sikhs saw the light
 he was  really  
i didn't lay a finger on him
your partner burned him
jake
jake
right now
now
we need to talk
the victim has been identified as desiree washburn age 26
is it sexual  
that is he has joined several prostitution agencies
three deaths in three days
i really want to hurt this guy mary
i need your help
catching dogs roam the forest
dutch looks for footprints and tire marks
so we find entry and exit points quickly
if this guy didn't give birth yes
 he is careless  not confidence has increased
there is something under the nail
do you have a pair of pliers  
this is an ancient compass needle
my assistant sikh also had one like this
didn't see him without it mary at least once
but the day after he died his wife came to take his belongings
couldn't even find a compass
don't you really think
first the color of your fingernails now the needles of sikh
tell yourself
how do you know it's not acting  
he has been suffering like this from childhood
do you have a reason for this  
at the age of ten he had a blood clot stuck in his brain during a fall
he was in a wheelchair for the next two years
damaged parts of the brain
a little aggravated after catching him
due to the excessive influence of inspector doyle
no i read the arrest report
it doesn't mention any of jake's influence
there was no more to it and for the next three months he received psychiatric treatment
 lefebvre    not
jake doyle i thought you knew
before he lit the candle
seek looked at me then smiled
that laugh a sound i never want to hear again it's absolutely evil
a completely evil smile  
jacob do you understand   an evil smile  
i really hope you don't put this in the incident report
because it shows unimaginable madness
inspector kelly
you knew you knew about nail color
a nail paint brush  
you told me to go and see you said
i told you to look it's not about what you find
so why a nail paint brush mr lefebvre  
what is the specialty  
because that's what i usually do
i had a personal item next to every body
forensics have always avoided it
it is an ancient work
something to do with death spend life after death
but you don't believe in life after death do you mary  
you know in the process of preparing a motion to have your sentence commuted
i'm not sure if it will go to the governor's desk
and mary
you are right
the copyist knows my work well
maybe too good that makes me wonder
honestly mary
there are some people who admire me
i have met some of them before the arrest
i have shared some secrets with them
so what could happen is that the suspect may be among these letters
i'll be happy to help you see these
no one can see my stuff except me
i need your word for it
you can trust me
mr lefebvre what do you know about a missing compass  
i don't know anything about a compass mary
in one of them a needle was found under a fingernail of the last victim
a picture  
a compass needle is missing
or the needle has lost its compass
what does that mean as a metaphor mary  
what
a desperation
or a lost soul looking for its way
am i sorry
i have some reading to do
i don't want to die
about your father
give him a week maybe
do you believe in life after death mary  
or a lost soul looking for its way
hey ah
what is that smell it feels like something is burning
that mastermind
the mastermind  
thank you
what was said about a mastermind  
removes negative thoughts
dale i'm not thinking about dad again okay  
i didn't mean to say a word about your father
sorry i this incident confuses me
let's eat
on to my next demonstration
i need someone to volunteer
ah
please sit down
please sir
sit down
now you become what i wish
hey are you sure it's okay for us not to go on the rome trip  
yes i know your job is important
what is that  
 are you sure it's the same person    yes sure he
he looked crazy as if he had succumbed to something
could this be the killer you're after  
he killed again
get some rest mary
i will also come with you
museum guards say the security cameras are five hours short
he took it this time why  
jake
 is that what i think    yes this is the sikh's compass
do not stir
this is doyle
to the evidence room
what is that   german  
ah the dutch i guess
het helse landschap fireland
wait what
are you ok  
before sikh died
he sent me this
this is an art book
newly discovered works of 16thcentury heronimus bosch
this is now out of print
i know where to get a book
land on fire
i have read this several times but
never understood what sikh was trying to say
samael
the artist said that name
samael is a fallen angel
 but he knows exactly  lucifer yes
i know that story
we thank father linares for his confession
yathikarma he attended
during his last time in ethiopia
it gives us a better understanding about the phenomenon of being in love
 what are we doing here    i want to introduce you to an old friend
have fun
thank you father allow me to introduce my assistant mary kelly
father i was wondering if you could take a look at mary's mood
i believe he needs pacification
what are you saying
he was caught in a negative force
of an evil man who was in the middle of one of our investigations
god i'm out of here
mary wait
what happened there  
i'm here to help
how can you help  
i study and learn a lot
i want to share them with you
i thought you were different from others
 but it seems i was wrong  no no no
i'm trying to catch a serial killer you're wasting time
jake you can believe what you want
read whatever you like in your spare time that's your business
but when blind faith gets in the way of your duty i have a problem
if you want another test tell the sheriff
i'm sure dutch
 willingly allow it  that's not what i'm saying
jake this is not good especially for you okay  
 hey this side of the car  i like hiking
mary
is he ok
pulse and respirations are normal he is fine
you have given many reports to keep him longer
i read your reports about harming him
that's a bit much in my opinion
do you have a medical degree  
a post graduate diploma in common sense
would you like to share information with me  
or should i go to the board of directors  
his mind fascinates me
i have studied him since the day he came here
however we both want to keep him here
dispatcher raynes sd751
the car used to kidnap the lt governor
met outside on parry avenue
the vehicle was found ready and waiting for csi
come on
these just arrived
thank you
ten minutes ago sir
yes yes i saw the pictures
i put them in your private email
ok ok
ah yes
i believe it's our only choice really
i mean
there is no obligation here but time is not on our side
definitely the governor
i had to tell the governor everything about us
about the request of the artist
come on
you know jake maybe you better stay out of this
take a break that's completely understandable
lt governor diaz doesn't fit
to any victim's details are you sure he's the one we're looking for  
his car was abandoned a few miles away
inside we found chloroform
more dove feathers everything fits
then there were these
it has been sent to the psychiatric hospital by courier
sent to arnaud lefebvre
he is trying to prove that he is a master
or
or does he show up  
he can brag well
i mean
the artist would never go after a celebrity like this checker
also i'm sure
i'm sure they've been talking since the beginning
maybe they use codes i do not know
we may soon find out
 what are you saying    dr losch agreed
let us find out
no i gave the artist my word
i don't like to take risks
 lose his trust  don't worry he doesn't know
ok
no please
do not
what are you doing
can't sleep
your communications order has been signed by the governor
valid on one condition
the lt governor should be met alive
 what is this    a medical examination
nonsense
 you have 45 minutes  yes that's a lot
this mug is familiar
do the work inspector
he killed again
i look back at asama when i was a kid
the rapture of santa teresa bernini's
and with that your friends came here
 that is not my idea  they left emptyhanded
i tried to stop them i am
do you remember what i said mary  
i'm helping you not them  
i burned all my letters
the ashes were put in the toilet and flushed
but not before remembering them
mr lefebvre please
tell me what you remember
you tell me something first mary
you tell me if you believe
if a man is free within his own mind
can he be locked up in a prison  
i didn't understand
the sketch
guys let's go
come here
the person who comes at two has arrived
don't make noise
what are you doing
what did i tell you guys  
why did you do that
no more religious nonsense stop
 these only distort the brain  stop
 i don't enjoy it  but i like it as the old master
if you want to draw something draw a dog or a real man just once
during those two years
i was confined to a wheelchair
but
jake you know all this don't you  
jake
come out from a place to come out
mr lefebvre i'm sure you had a difficult childhood
but now the time is very limited
now you have to tell me about the copycat
please
my sculptures are finished with clay
i will refill them please tell me about the copier
the gentleman you are looking for
a renaissance art forger
mainly religious stuff
i used to go to a charming little antique shop called landon and sons
they as always
lies were exhibited mary
we are not open yet
we are not customers
 you can't break like this  without a warrant  
jake
what is this
when the artist talked about a painting he said
who drew this  
he did not want to say his name
i paid him in cash and never saw him again
we have to seize this evidence
hey when did you get a search warrant  
didn't get it i always keep an empty one
nobody ever reads them
if you knock on the devil's door he will answer
that's the crazy guy who broke into my house
mary wait
wait
you should have heard what i said mary
place your hands above your head
 it's too late now  back off
 i shoot i shoot  shoot mary
you don't have the strength to pull the trigger
i wanted to warn you
not
javier salazar the one who attacked you
an employee of the company till the last year
worked as a nurse
we compared his dna with the dna from the saliva in this envelope
it was the pictures of lt governor diaz
what we already know is that he has been in contact with the artist for days
he was the person in charge of the medicine
i already looked at salazar's reports
he was sent because of his mental state
acute psychosis according to dr losch
he looks like a psycho so hard to believe
he can kill like this
we can't say for sure until dna reports come in
but i'm pretty sure he's our man mary
we still have a missing woman sir
the lab guys look for sand in salazar's shoes
we need to find out exactly where he was
how about that picture  
here
a big toe probably due to wet paint
i asked sikh for a full confession
instead i asked him to sit and paint this picture
also i would like to give you that chance too
definitely i can totally draw from memory
would you like to sit for me  
got a fingerprint from the picture detective
did you look it up in the database and compare it to salazar's  
this belongs to a woman really
we found his fingerprints during a prostitution bust years ago
 name and address    everything is here
hey what's going on  
i will give details as i go
take more people
you will want to see this
no this can't be him this has been here for a long time
it takes years to dry like this
he must have tested him to preserve him
this entire house has been turned into an art gallery
measure the digestibility
i don't touch it
poison  
it may be the juice taken from castor beans
other girls used heterosexuals
one drop can kill a horse
that means bosch not bosch
but this fake picture is here
like playing with salazar's dna
i do not think
jake is welcomed into the artist's home
he plays with us
he used his own mother for testing
salazar's dna
can't compare
you knew we could find that house from that picture
you wanted to find your mother why  
because i want you to understand who i really am
i read every public report
with your name and your court records
i have a good understanding of who you are
did you ever think there was any truth about me mary  
not included in those reports  
it all started when i was working
in the picture of the ground burning with fire
then i heard a voice
it was the voice of the angel samael
why am i asking about these things  
that voice opened my ears and eyes
about who i really am
you gave me nothing but a copycat
i will tell the governor
you're the only one i can tell you where to find him
why do i believe you  
do you have anything else to do  
by the time i finish this you will have his address
i promise you
what's over  
the sculpture
your statue
you are a sick man
because you don't understand anything
if the lieutenant governor dies you go to the electric chair
you don't care
what are you doing
waiting
are you serious now  
to die
be comfortable
if you need the address
here's the deal
you have ten minutes no more seconds
when the ten minutes are up you give me the address
agree shall we begin
the human body is a divine creation
with beauty and creativity
but that cannot be said
about the human mind
it is weak and corrupt
creating a sculpture is like solving a mystery
every line is a destination
every observation is a road map
all feeling and emptiness
hidden within the soul
you know mary when i first look at someone
that his story will be revealed to me  
your story is about a young woman
there are scars from terrible disasters that happened in childhood
we all have old wounds
wounds are the trademark of soldiers aren't they  
god could have healed your wounds
but you have turned your back on him why mary
my father
a man you haven't seen in years
you still refuse to see
all he wants is to say goodbye to you
you're not guessing anymore how do you know that  
why don't you see him mary  
you don't know what he put on me
what did he put on you  
did he abuse you like my mother did to me  
no no
you and i are not the same
that guy he never touched me he
he puts his hand in the furnace and then
he says this is what happens in hell
i couldn't stop him
can you smell her burning skin  
i still can
that is you made him responsible for his suffering
it's like parts of a really bad dream mary
tell me about them
they started when they fell
where do you fall  
to ginigoda
the burning is so real i still feel it when i get up in the morning
are you still having those bad dreams mary  
not
as soon as i gave up belief in hell they were gone
my father can't scare me with them
but that made him try harder didn't he mary  
he said i was possessed
i need help that's when he took me to confession
is that where you first hypnotized him  
in the confessional booth  
who to hypnotize  
father who heard your confession
father dale now the one who sleeps in your bed
who are you talking to   who told you these things  
do you know why he sleeps with you mary  
do you know
i don't want to answer those questions
would you like me to tell you why  
stop stop
we fell in love
love  
are you in love  
he chose a different life with me
so it's true love right  
yes
when you tell it to yourself mary
 do you believe it    yes
 do you really believe that    yes
 i don't think so  i believe
or are you just doing it to get rid of your hatred for your father  
thanks for sitting for me mary
it is much appreciated
now it's your turn
address now
the address is 1522 lola court
is that loud enough  
or shall i repeat it for your friends  
1522 lola court guys let's go
mary you forgot something
this is for you
always remember mary
you can always find the truth only within yourself
put away  
why didn't you go with the others  
i thought those men would arrest someone without me
ok but this is your test one of us
i like being here now
come on mary
my goodness
my goodness
i i don't understand how he knows these things about my life
i have said those things to only one person
not not it can't be
he puts things in my head right  
truth can only be found within he said
who said that  
wait what are you doing
archibald are you crazy  
son of a bitch
 i'm going crazy  265 opal road
that's the right address do you know where this is  
yes
is there anyone
what the hell is this
this is me this this is my whole life this
world on fire
hell in latin
mary we need to report this
say i will take some pictures of this right  
252 vehicles to headquarters
hi this is dale leave a message
governor diaz  
yes who are you
i'm the one who's trying to get you out of here
ok
 how do you unlock this    that devil man he has the key
 where is he    he is holding
bring your hands above your head
theran
mary
jake  
yes and no
i promised to help find the killer mary
here he is
jake what's wrong with you  
jake is not here anymore
no prison can
lock a free man inside remember mary  
lefebvre  
that's right
you still want to hear the rest of my story mary
mom destroyed all my art books
make me find something new to wear
that's when i discovered my potential
after drawing one's likenesses
i can temporarily move away from my body and into theirs
i kept it a secret for years
afraid of a curse
finally the angel samael
it was released as a reward
 who did the main thing for me
ever since the souls entered my body
i was born an angel mary
angel of death
come back come back
jake please jake come back please
no no no no
i honored the agreement
the lieutenant governor lives
the murderer will die soon
i can't do it without you
now finish the job mary
once
over here
do not be afraid
mary  
where am i
i'm very sorry
jake i'm sorry
jake it's you
you are still the copycat
you stop him mary
now you're free to join up with your old mate jacob
go
go
the city can now breathe freely
because of the brave actions of inspector mary kelly
ending the killing spree of his former assistant jake doyle
and saving the life of the lieutenant governor
do you want to meet me sir  
i know this is not the happy ending we wanted
but you saved that woman's life
psychiatrists say jake suffered
in the same way that dualpersonality is a dissociation
it started in the first incident
that's why he thought he was an artist
they are the experts
what do you think mary  
you were there that night
because of what i think he will not come back sir
the jake i knew couldn't do this
i have known jake for a long time
i still can't wrap my head around it
someone who believes in me
don't be afraid of the dark
may the lords look with kindness
elias kelly for you
in the name of the father and the son
and in the name of the holy spirit
amen
glad to have met your father before he died
me too
hmmm can i have a minute  
ok
dr losch
may she rest in peace mary kelly
do you know my aunt dr losch  
not i wanted to see you
didn't come to see didn't speak
not even a letter mary magdalene  
i was waiting for you to come
i miss you too mary
you never wanted to kill the lieutenant governor did you  
absolutely right
i just gave his boss an urgent need
no mary
next you
why this game  
you could have drawn a picture of the security guard and come out
you can escape anytime
to be hunted like an animal for the rest of my life  
i do not think
running away was never in my mind mary
i can't see a better place
do my homework
i will help soon
when i cleanse your soul mary
today could have been that day
the day of my death isn't it great  
i think a little more than you do
what does it mean  
i have a question to ask you
you drew dr losch with a black pencil didn't you  
 what    a black graphite pencil
it was among the art supplies that came to your prison yesterday
i think you thought they were sent by a fan of yours
no i sent them
did you see i saw that you had this habit
chewing on the end of a pencil
to that i added a few drops of your own special chemical
the kind you used on your own mother
you are lying
i should have put it in evidence but
i think jake taught me some bad habits
have a nice day
you know i was thinking about going on the trip you mentioned
 to rome    yes let's do it

monotony bores me
the same old song for thousands of years
they expect that singing
i like to listen to a new tune
a beautiful danceable rhythm
then i will rise from the grave
i can babble in a place that renews me
where i can thrive under the sun
a place that can be called my home
open my eyes sing my song
stay awake but dream
live a life of my own
thousands of years from now

ah you smile
 ah  listen definitely
something has gone wrong here ah

lahdre pakistan
what are you looking at
it's cancer
not a pretty girl's instagram
how much time do i have  
3 years
may be
india has taken a surprising decision today
the special verdict for kashmir has been annulled
the indian parliament announced today that it will end article 370
after that the ministry of foreign affairs of pakistan condemned this unanimous action and said
pakistan is considering every step and ready to respond
370 has been cancelled how do you do that  
wrong sir isn't it  
no not wrong
a declaration of war
did you say 3 years  
enough
the time for strategy is over sir
if they sit until the un resolves india's next step
our free kashmir will be (azad kashmir)
a devotee of god cannot answer them
it's time to make friends with the devil
jim
general qadir is speaking to you
general kadir are you ok
not good
destruction is needed
what to do  
hindustan should be brought to its knees
guess what general  
when the bullet comes out
it doesn't go back to the gun
you have to think
can do
it takes time but it will work
after 3 years
somewhere in africa
not caught by the radar
does not stop at any signal
not afraid of any turn
the understander does not understand
once launched
then it was as if the jinn had left hell (an intelligent spirit lower than angels meaning doom)
and the days of doom begin to count
good
jim will say where this should go
why  
does he not trust you  
to the gym
if god tells him to ask for anything
then he will say
that you have something to do with this (it means that he does not even believe in god)
only jim sees jim's card
boss
is this person rafe  
why  
one came
he asked someone called rafe
they said we don't know anyone called rafe
he says rafe is coming to meet fayed
where is he
in the vip area
while receiving special treatment
who are you  
hey hindi
talk
say in hindi
there will be no fun in scolding you in arabic
now surprised you take 5 seconds
after thinking for 5 seconds
where have you heard this voice before  
after 5 seconds you won't believe it
then you will ask
pathan       
you  
 srk 
living
where is he (she)  
how did you survive
i asked you the question first
where is rubai  
phew
pathan sir's heart is broken
you can't hide love and fragrance
very far from you
now you are going too far
any last message  
he has a gift to give
the moth is broken rafe
dance
kill the face
what are you looking at  
the whole world is on fire
when you are constantly scaring
every breath of life is crying for help
there is no one near him
watching with a dark face full of darkness
ghanandakara spread in the decade
all our hopes and beliefs are destroyed
but there is no one who can resist
heeyak came forward
to banish evil
and to make everything right
to attack
he finds love(as a weapon)
shining with light
he is that night
kill the face
the weather's going to get rough rafe
fasten your seat belt
close the door close the door
sorry rafe
 pathan 
 pathan 
new delhi india
jocr head quarters
coming barun
if you're cutting the cake how am i going to finish the job  
you light the candles start singing the happy birthday song
i'll be home before the candle melts
mom
we got a red signal (a warning)
our face scanner software has just detected a face
who is that
rubai  
where is  
paris security cameras at palais royal metro station
how long has it been  
15 minutes max
deploy a team now
tell him to listen do not interfere
take the plane
use the blue channel we need permission to take off as soon as possible
that's right ma'am
oh and tell barun
to keep your piece of cake in the fridge
how long will it take  
about 5 hours at most
mom   um  
mom we
going for pathan   (chasing pathan  )
what do you know about pathan  
not much ma'am
but
when people hear his name they feel uncomfortable
the title is also changed
mom he's on our side isn't he  
was on our side
what is the side  
he was our front line
opening batsman opening bowler
he was a wicket keeper as well as a 4 slip (four slip fielder)
you know if pathan was not there
then you are not here
neither do i
and there is no jocr department
during an operation in myanmar 2 years ago
pathan was very badly injured
he was in the hospital for weeks it
it was an uncertain moment (between life and death)
everyone thought that pathan's chapter was over
but we didn't know this
since writing a completely new book
2 years ago
indian army hospital new delhi
i heard you were badly injured
mom
yes
a metal plate on the leg
a titanium disk in the neck
and bioabsorbable screws in the shoulder
you seem to be doing well
very difficult ma'am
at the airport security beep beep beep they are looking for metal
it seems to me that retirement does not suit you
why  
retirement is a comfort pathan
how many ways are there  
i think now is the time
becoming a master chef tomorrow (an indian reality show)
indian idol tomorrow (a singing competition)
now
you should have a hobby too pathan
found
kintsugi
is it a punjabi word  
japanese i know you know what it means
know
if something valuable breaks
the japanese collect those pieces with gold
it increases its beauty as well as its strength and in that
it is accepted that it is more valuable than before
ma'am you look at this file
these are the broken pieces of our organization
soldier madam like me
those who retired prematurely due to some injury or trauma
but it didn't end
their passion and guts are still full
they are ready to break and leave the country even today
what do you want to do  
combine these people and make a new unit  
yes ma'am
do you know how many levels and how many people you need to convince  
no matter how much red tape you say your hands will get stuck
check it out
what do you think ma'am  
for so many months i grew hair  
i tried
and sure enough i did
play  
join operations and covert research mom (joint operations and covert investigations)
are you giving me a job  
no ma'am  
i am my boss's
the chair is given again
were you looking for a new hobby  
try kintsugi please
all the soldiers who are separated and left behind
looking for a purpose
ready for a mission
you are the gold
you can get them all together
stronger than before
more dangerous than before
that's how jocr groups were born
every operation is important for the country
but no one can
no one can bear the responsibility for it
that was our playground
we had no laws that could stop us
so those who felt the need of law
they had a problem with us
like
like our colonel luthra
wow
beautiful
very beautiful
here for us and other departments an entertainment club was to be built
gym sauna pool table
more
sauna   pool table  
i'm sorry sir you really can't be
these are my officers  they are not officers
grab a few jokers that have broken all fours and you've got a joker(jocr) team
all these are shells of a broken egg that is all
how are you
a dead giveaway guys
rishi dead work  thank you sir
what do you think i really oh no ma'am
oh what pathan i was just pretending
or i told one of my superiors that way
never
don't be a baby
admittedly rishi's production is very realistic
but pathan don't play with me
isn't this a good time    no sir
oh
a little to the side smooth
and he has dark circles under his eyes you missed it
have you seen luther's double chin  
as for how long it is it's around the stomach
then luthra's stomach tumor
sir
dead
a serious department
now i can make the very best recommendation to the secretary of defense
i said before all of you are broken eggs called shells that is all
stomach ma'am
sir sir
sir when you come wait two minutes please
i want to show you something
aeroflot 394c  144 injured
dish said it was their job
norwegian ship asgard
the robbers destroyed it in the gulf of eden
the biggest environmental disaster of this decade
courtesy of boko haram
chemical attack on japan
japan's outfit elef took responsibility for it
do you think i didn't get these details  
no sir not elef
if not boko haram then daish
at least not directly related
they outsourced all these attacks
to a private terrorist group
they are not working for any purpose they are just working on contract
is it  
does that mean that the terrorists are showing support  
let's admit that there is such a group so what  
this is an interpol issue not a problem in india
to tell you the truth sir
now it is
because the next episode is special for india
and this one is a big one
in dubai
sir got to know this from dark net outfit x
something big is being planned in dubai next week
in asian scientists summit
two of our scientists will represent india for that and our
to that conference our president
the main speech is going to be delivered
they chase after the president
we think so too sir
i will make sure to triple the security
he will not even be able to come to the president
thank you sir
thank you there is one more request sir
only if you don't think anything
with me this
eggshells will also come there
trust me luthra
you take care of the president's security
we will take care of outfit x
dubai uae
because of the president we cannot take risks pathan
but frankly speaking your information is confusing
i changed the president's itinerary at the last minute
there is no sign of an explosion
there is no such place where a sniper can take a target
nothing suspicious pathan
the information is true sir
but now all signals are silent
either they must be very careful or 
sir you said that you changed the course of the president what was there before  
along with a special force two scientists and a media team were going to travel
show that you support science
now on a different path with full security
then where are our scientists   are they traveling with the president  
no the focus of the security forces changes after a few vehicles go by
i want our nsg commandos to focus on the president himself
then the two scientists who were traveling with full nsg protection
now we have changed that plan
shit
put all these strategies and make us change our plans
they're not targeting the president sir
i thought i was taking a selfie with the president
the lady will also be happy (surprised)
do you still want to impress your lady after 30 years  
science is easy farooqui love is the hardest
patriot
sir we have been attacked
you're right pathan
they attacked the scientists' guards
shweta lock me to the gps of the scientist's phone
doing this sir  right now
wait don't shoot don't shoot
dr sahani dr faruqi
listen to me be a little more afraid than you
you guys are so screwed
he takes the two scientists in a gray hummer pathan
sir i have sent you the location of the hummer
there sir there is that hummer
 john abraham 
pathan
i have been waiting for this meeting for a long time
while on raw you have heard a lot about yourself
my name is jim
jim  
you also got to know that i died
so then  
ok i am really dying for india
here is the evidence
medal of valor
i died a hero
how are you jim  
i heard  the smartest person  
it is correct to hear i'm still there (still the best)
she breaks my heart
you will be broken too
you know her
the difference is i thought i was his lover
then you
son (thinking)
mother india
but you are lucky
you will die with this lie that your patriotism had some meaning
i'm sure a medal like this would be a tribute to your body too
you will be called a martyr
but the loss to the country  
is zero
if life changed sometimes we would be friends
but pathetic
we have to play with the cards we are dealt
then this round all asians in my hand
raza raza rishi rishi
rishi
my seat belt i'm stuck
pathan take off my seat belt
rishi
get out
my legs are stuck sir
my leg is stuck sir
rishi
my leg is stuck come on come on rishi
pathan  my leg is stuck sir
pathan we have to go
wait
raza  this car is going to blow up pathan
rasa run away with sarva  pathan you can't do anything now
sir you go  wait wait
pathan there is nothing we can do
sir it is my honor
pathan we have to go
pathan
jai hind
block the road
now these two choppers are not yours
crashes directly into the building
well pathan what's the idea  
everyone's lives are hanging on this rope
but only you can untie this rope
so what are you doing friend  
sacrificing lives   or equivalent knowledge  
say hello to mother india
say i will come to meet soon
my transactions are still pending
jim
you can't even believe about someone's death
was jim on raw  
kabir like jim
our best representatives
there were many similarities
calculations meticulousness systematicity
not like our pathan sir
first listen to your heart
then to his superiors
so what went wrong  
one thing
that ongc drilling team attacked the somalifaced robbers
yes
jim went at it alone
he rescued 6 hostages without any harm
they swore to avenge themselves
finally they found jim
they demanded 10 crores for the lives of jim and his wife
but we do not come to an agreement with the terrorists (not discussing)
you love your country very much
but your country
i don't love you
do not
do not do not
do not do not
do not
do not
do not
do not
please
please leave him alone
do not
do not
do not
do not
do not
do not
but jim's body was never found we thought he was dead
jim was awarded the medal of valor
an uncle of his came to take it
for such an agent for his family
couldn't you pay the ransom  
your department is not short of funds sir
the funds are not for our personal work pathan
great honesty sir
what if it was a minister's family  
even weak people bend their knees pathan
not soldiers
and now this soldier
we will be forced to bend our knees
colonel
i saw in his eyes
ok wrong
beyond good and bad
because of your one decision in his eyes all his crimes were forgiven
then now
he
won't stop
shweta see if there is any information on the darknet
raktabij
what is that  
the word was used two or three times on the dark net
raktabij it looks like just code
someone's   something  
did you recognize those who died in dubai   yes sir
sir all of them are exmilitary or secret agents
a few days ago money was credited to their accounts
from one account  
yes
from a pakistani doctor rubina mohsin
staying in london
his account was not active for months
this is only the transfer of money
who knows whether he knows it or not
if he used his account the bank will send an alert
the email was hacked he hasn't logged in for a month
the frequently used phone is also off but two hours ago it was used for a web check
book a flight
to where  
if there was someone else it would be a flight to iraq or syria
but your destiny

an endless supply of coffins
the name of the corpse is just changing

working according to our will to our value
join us pathan

a woman
yours ma'am
let's go  of course
listen
are you exisi  
not ex
what did you think you were the only one eyeing outfit x  
staying with them secretly for a year
so why these things  
because i can get what i want quickly with you
with me
when did we get together  
when i saved your life
you put my life in danger
you
you know that eh   you
run where are you  
where are you going
hey wait get down
great shot
the aim is not bad your
their
dad
dad
morning
he was unconscious for only 18 hours
sleep a little longer
the fever is down
no infection and luckily the bullet did not hit any vital organs
in your sleep you called daddy and cried
he said in his sleep let my father go
father
a journalist in the middle east
someone who asks a little too many questions
a lot of answers were needed so
tortured him
more
the family was given the balcony seat
after that you moved to pakistan with your mother where you joined the medical college
dr rubina mohsin
then for the sake of humanity you
joined the isi
oh sure
cheers
have you ever found a drink that is cheaper than this  
this is we don't have much money for isi
but seriously
why did you save my life  
is your good looks and personality not enough  
generally enough i am very sexy
but you said that what you want will happen soon with me
hmm
so i want to know
what do we want  
raktbeij
have you heard
there was an asura a monster
where a drop of his blood falls there
another raktbeej will be born
in short killing raktbij is impossible
whatever raktbeij is it's in russia
and after 7 days
and 7 days later  
what  
after 7 days jim will deliver the raktbeej
and whatever happens after that something very bad happens
so in short we have  7 days
realized
cheers
bottoms up (for agreeing to partnership)
i think you didn't go to school then when you were teaching chapters about india and isi
this is it our relations are not so good
also when we first met you held jim's gun to my head
do you remember
so don't take it personally but
i have some trust issues
but some things are more important than our belief
yes exactly 7 days
also rathkbeij
so are you coming to work  
or not coming  
hmm
so what if i come  
and if i take a bath  
russia is a very big place
some street name
any landmarks   you know some things
412 volts (safe)
moscow
voskwich tower
you know the address
your appointment was in russia for 3 years
yes
what else do you know about me  
do you want to tell me everything right now  
i feel scared
did an isi agent say there was something in moscow that jim wanted  
yes ma'am
but we have heard the name of rakhtbej before on darknet
do you know what it is  
no ma'am
thereforesomething that existswhere it islet it be there
i know you know every corner of russia
but russia is still a friendly country and an important party
if there is any humiliation it will not be tolerated moscow or delhi
ma'am you know jim wants a bloodbath
if he can't buy it he steals
what if you get caught  
then don't try to negotiate
i'm not jim
shit
this raktbeij whatever
can't let it go to jim's hand
isi also
go get it
love you ma'am
moscow russia
welcome
i will show you around sir
um i'd say the same to you (that he knows more about russia than wrestling)
an english dictionary
thank you sir thank you
if you need anything talk to andre
happy honeymoon to you then
you didn't even say it was our honeymoon
if you refuse andre's heart will break
look where else can you find a view like this  
wow
i never thought that i would see such a big building on my honeymoon night
if you are with me you can have fun like this
most of the global corporate offices are in this building
voskwich tower
this is the vosquich tower
and it has the world's best safe on the 92nd floor
92 ni layer
92 ni layer
safe deposit box
imagine a room 30 feet long and wide (30ft x 30ft)
no key can open it
no explosion can break
no laser beam can cut
and cannot be burned by any acid
can't cut can't break can't explode can't burn (set fire)
you can open it
but but but there is only one problem
not only the key of the safe but also the lock is kept in a safe place
when i want to open it an uncle brings the lock from his house
and one aunt the key
then the lock is the river and when the key meets the jamuna it opens
so you mean we have to steal both the lock and the key  
yes exactly right
but this is the problem
this lock is in uncle gregor's office 12 km away from the safe
12 km
uncle gregor
then the key is 16km away our karen aunty is in her office
16 km
karen aunty
then both these offices are in opposite directions
karen aunty
uncle gregor
and the best part is
we have to steal both of these in 10 minutes and go to the safe
what did you say   what  
i love this sugar free yogurt
when this lock and key are taken from the respective places a timer starts
then within 10 minutes at fbs hq someone has to code all is well
this is one of us said
not rubai and pathan
or
or  
it is completely sealed that's all
then lock and key wishes nothing works
system in three places until reset
game over
but how do we get to the safe in 10 minutes with the traffic in moscow  
first step:
to get to our lock we have to open another lock
and need to open that lock uncle gregor's fingerprints
isn't that the case with the local police  
why  
because you
like a bomb
oh
blow up  i will definitely do it
boom
second step:
our key holder aunty karen
are you corrupting him  
i do but i'm not his type
but that night
how many sleeping pills will be in his food  
you are my own kiran (sings tuhi meri kiran from shahrukh's 1993 movie darr)
you are mine karen
good night
kakakakaren (in darr he stutters and mumbles)
the third step
we need two planes and two pilots for it
two more
did you understand this place  
no our two pilots
pilots  
ok
they are late very professional
ah that's actually what we're going to do for us
it's their hobby
they are singers by profession
singers  
singers
it goes you pay the bill
rubai listen eat some cheese
and now step four
what step is this  
either way it'll be fun
are you and your wife looking for something special  
very specific
what about wanting to find 20000 baubles     (breasts are called boobs in english)
rubles (currency of russia)
what did i say
i meant rubles
let's sleep soon tomorrow is a big day
we have a meeting with raktbeij
our last step
ah
ah
i think you
these honeymoon decorations seem to be taken a little too seriously
tomorrow we have a meeting with raktbeij so
take a break may be
it may be the last night spent outside the russian prison so
so it's not good to waste anyway
yes wasting is not the best
sometimes i
help with bandages  
what   bandages   definitely
i also thought that the bandage should be changed
pathan
i mean are you really a pathan  
are you a muslim  
i don't know rubai what am i   who
who are my parents  
or why did you leave me in a cinema hall
first in an orphanagethen in a juvenile center
after that to the remand home (a place where minor children are kept)
imagine
my country raised me
so when i grew up i thought
as a good son
i want to serve my parents
so i joined the indian army
i'm very sorry  no it doesn't matter
not that
what movie was shown in that movie hall where you met
you don't take feelings seriously do you   (not being a slave to emotions)
do you take
never
so
how is the cow (worshipped) of lavaris' (orphan)   (amitabh bachchan also has two films / one who receives blessings from an orphan)
in 2002
in afghanistan we were in a joint operation with the american army
my first mission
america's target that day was saladin hussaini
usa army headquarters afghanistan
a taliban leader
a missile was locked to the gps location of his phone
but he is wrong saladin hussain…
a maulana who teaches in a madrasa school
people started running
the problem was that madrasa school
there were 30 children
and the missile was due to arrive in minutes
the missile was locked to the location of the phone
and there were still children inside
i was in a coma for a month
but not a single day passed
anyone in that village for my life
unwished
subhanallah
how are you
adab salaam
all the blessings of these villagersfrom today only for you
god is true no pathan mother
no one was born braver than you
from today we are yours and you are ours
our pathan
but you know what  
even today i try to
on the occasion of eid
celebrate with them
with my pathan family
once the bag is picked up only 10 minutes are left remember
ok rubai start your time alarm
3 2 1
now
karen you are close
who are you
rubai
my release function is not working properly
rubai you have to cut your rope when you reach the building
captain listen to me
are you mad  
get it done
what  
we are 90 seconds late the alarm goes off in a minute let's go
safe number   412
how do these stairs open  
there is no time for that
here
put it to me
pathan
i'm very sorry
going to that safe is impossible
can do
to pathan
pathan  
why is he helping you  
matecheck
you mean checkmate  
when the king feels that the queen is ready to sacrifice her life for him
then all his attention is focused on saving the queen
also when you realize that the queen is playing by changing sides
it's too late
end
raja
dead
the present
then
russians captured pathan
yes
and tortured a lot
black prison
not this
don't do this
he is very tired
don't do thisdon't do this
nonotoo big
says pathan
you know
finally everyone is talking
your hindi is very good
did your mother go to hindustan  
or a joint operation  
we know
that you can bear a lot
how much more
pathan was put in a high security prison
i saw him there for the last time
he is not with us (not one of us)
oh please miss gravel
we know he is an agent of marcos
was he crossed the line
do you think we will support this stupid thing  
whatever he does we have nothing to do with it
i mean you have no problem with how we deal at this time  
do this for me
and this if chance survives
then drop two bullets from my side
i will pay the loss
i'm going to crush your bones
you are a walking corpse
what did he say  
i will kill you do what you can
friends time off friends
please
wait wait wait

 present day 
tiger to pathan in russia
so where did pathan disappear for so long  
pathan was defeated by someone for the first time
he swore
without rubai jim raktbeij
he won't come back
and because of the diplomatic relations with russia
we missed him
and now  
pathan's exile period
over
put two bullets in the bus from my side
what else can you say  
like a son of mine
don't worry too much  
but how did luthra allow you to come there  
don't even ask he wanted to come himself
he'll shoot you dead with his own hands
if he had the slightest doubt
i came there you
i came to give a message
he is not with us (not one of us)
why are you here
tiger is coming
did you hear anything from rafe  
jim has taken two saber missiles
but he doesn't know why
and where is jim  
also
where is he  
paris   when
a few hours ago
activities  
walking cafes
maybe waiting for someone to come
then you have to go
it's not good to make a girl wait
pathan i don't know what you stole from the russians
but we have never seen such stress from them
find it
find jim
mom
paris france
salaam alaikum
wa 'alaykum assalaam (says several)
thank you raza
there is no need for three people in this romantic city
a moment for two
i want to make a lovely romantic story with this
alone
alone raza
thank you
so do you want to talk or do you want to kill me  
i thought when i met you
shoot first
after that they will question
but now you call me here
definitely rubai
your photo came to our computers easily from the subway in france
you knew it
that cctv footage will come to me then i
to you
so here i come
say what you have to say quickly
raktbeej
want to know what it is  
what is it
smallpox  
but it was eradicated in 1980
yes
however some research centers still have samples today
if you ever need to fight a virus
just like in russia
like we stole it
but why  
are smallpox vaccines available in every country in the world  
something like this is an emergency
the vaccine works with the old smallpox virus
jim mutated that virus
latest
a more dangerous virus was created we have no vaccine for it
there is no resistance
that is why he is planning such a big operation to kidnap dr sahani in dubai
who is all this for   who will pay him  
do you know general kadir  
time to make friends with the devil
your government no
but the extremists of the isi are joined with it
when article 370 was abolished in hindustan
pathan i swear
i had no idea whatsoever
my own people
that he is ready to do such a crazy thing
if this virus spreads
then how can pakistan save itself  
jimmy changed the dna of this virus
it shows symptoms not in a week like covid19
after a few hours the effect will set in and die
that means no one can take this virus and travel anywhere
if you start like that
an entire city can be destroyed in a few days
but it can be controlled within the city limits
the danger lies only in the target cities
not to the whole world
how are you rubai  
how do i know that i will trust you again  
i am a soldier pathan
like you
you can do anything for your country
but this
the death of millions of innocent people
this is not my war
trust me pathan
just one more time
my attention will always be on you
with one wrong step
many wrong steps were taken (blood ne thi blood writes)
now those marks need to be erased
where is jim
in two days he is going to meet dr sahani in his lab
tell me about this lab
everything
nice to see you too sir
hmhmif we are alive let's hug
everyone go back to work
even if you are alive you will not be embraced
landing with parachutes
loading hereto the lab
straight down from there
rubai
pathan
after what happened in russia how can you trust him again  
ok
don't believe
next plan
a missile
put the lab in the same explosions
jimthe viruseverything
if the virus is not destroyedif it is added to the air
the virus from the sky straight from the clouds with the rain
mahadwama can be broken down into three
ok pathan
do it
mom
alsocut your hair
rubai
jim
looks good
always
but it's like you've never seen it before
who said that love happens only at first sight  
want to sink  
i know the difference between sea and lava
270 subpoena made on behalf of soom lk
is it designed as i said  
do you really want to do this  
for money  
do you think it's all about money  
i can rob a bank from home doctor
i was once asked a question
how much are you worth  
the value of your family  
your child's
this is my answer today
the value of your life
i will give
if possible
then buy it
this is crazy
these are your own people
your country
oh doc
country border everything
these are meant to remind weak people of their place
because the real work needs to continue
power
and control
now i have no feeling for any country
where am i
that is my country
that's my world
i will see
stay away
if anything happens to this you will cut your own throat
dr sahani
dr sahani
give me those orbs
these orbs are safe
let's go
jim i protect the bloodhound
usually when you lie how easy is it  
i felt how scared you were of me
jim trust me make your people understand rubai
that you betrayed them
general kadir is not my people
when my people realized what he did
they hang it
ii have one daughter
i wanted you to be alive to see his daughter too
the bag  
it should be near
give it to me pathan
no sir we have to destroy this
this needs to end now
not at all
if jim had mutated the smallpox virus
so we have to prepare a vaccine first
i don't think so sir give me that
sir
sir
pathan
what the hell sir what is going on  
he is an isi pathan
because of him we found one orb of this virus
and because of him this virus went to jim
he knows all of jim's plans
we have to question him pathan ma'am
and where will he go now  
both jim and the isi are looking for him
if you leave it
can't stay alive even for two days
take him away wait
pathan
nothing happens
a promise of pathan
where is jim
where is pratiweirasa hiding  
where are the missiles launched  
were you with him with a plan  
now you are saying that you don't know anything about accepting us
nobody knows anything
what is jim thinking what is he planning
only jim knows
if you feel that the plan is messed up
he has a backup
thisnowif it happens at this time
so he has a backup plan ready
otherwise
this is his plan
center for infectious diseases india
ma'am you have to pull this suit
yes doctor
your message came as soon as i received it
come on nandani you have something to show me  show show
there were three layers to the center of the orb
you cut it then
then it came up to the central core
with the virus
there is nothing in it  what  
we checked everything
that's water only water
what happened to these lights  
ma'am our system has been hacked
a video call is coming
that's jim
connect him
hello hello how is everyone  
how did it feel
is there only pure water in the center of the orb  
what the hell are you doing jim  
that's my plan if someone tries to force open this orb say so
this orb has three layers
the first layer was left blank
just a void
but the second layer was not empty
it contained an invisible corrosive gas
an acid
it melts even plastic on contact
just like the suits you are wearing
then in the third layer was my superstar
raktbij
it has spread everywhere where you are
and the center has the purest clean water
when you die
if you feel thirsty
think i'm just reading  
look at your beautiful white suit
isn't that what makes it black  
those suits are useless
that virus you found in the water
it has already entered your body
if we calculate that the pain is 10 times as piercing
you will experience at least 13 or 14
exciting right  
this is the rehearsal of raktbeij
so please definitely share your moment of death on instagram and twitter
what do you see  
that's what sells
cheers
not
lock down the lab
lock the lab
lock the lab
lock the lab
everyone else get out soon
we seal the entire lab
now get out go right now everyone get out
we can purify the entire atmosphere
uv rays gamma rays
how do you clean people luthra  
the virus is now inside us
now there is only one way
a very limited number of people get this right
he gets to decide how his death should happen
afraid hesitant nervous  
i beat a terrorist
that selfsatisfaction will not be allowed
i am a soldier
then now
all of you
everyone dies one day
we have what was written today
accept it
colonel
you know what to do
don't save rdx
we're going to die anyway
but the virus cannot spread at all
thank you
thanks everyone
it is an honor to serve with you
you are that gold
put my life back together
mom
you are the gold pathan
keep them all together
strengthen them
every day
it's you
don't stop
catch jim
i am
i promise ma'am
give him such a death
he thinks that our death is easy
mom
i can't see guns
om namah shiva
hello everyone
i know this is a very sad time for you
and i respect that pain
so trying
don't show too much happiness
but come on
a great plan isn't it  
you are worth appreciating
you are an indian soldier dammit
thank you
now i am an indian businessman
if you are alive maybe tomorrow you will be my client
then something is presented
currently the client is someone else
i am doing what he wants now
do you know what you are doing  
he unleashes his anger on the entire human society
history will remember that you are a beast
oh
i didn't think about that
what are you doing now  
everything is ready
my saber missile armed and ready
such a place
only i know
target
an indian city
only i know that too
but sorry
you destroyed your research lab before you knew what the bloodbees could do
but when this falls in delhi mumbai hyderabad or amratsar
what do you do then  
will the entire city be bombed and destroyed  
what do you want  
i want you to negotiate with one terrorist colonel luthra
what you didn't do for me
now doing the same with me
what do you want  
what do you think  
kashmir
obviously kashmir
you have 24 hours
after 24 hoursa single indian soldier
one tank one gun
or if only one flag could be seen in kashmir
it is impossible
how to do it in 24 hours  
we need some time think
maybe i used the wrong word that's why you are confused
this is not a negotiation colonel luthra
this is the final announcement
your time begins
now
the situation you all are in now
the fear in your eyes
i'm over it
it was my wife's
there was no one responsible for the death of the child even though i was there
there is no one responsible for your death today
how does it feel guys  
but saying jai hind is not appropriate
so be careful
not much time left
pathan somehow stop this crazy man
look at this your innocent family
when they came home did they put a shroud on their heads  
wherever those missiles go your family will get there before everyone else
where is the missile  
my work
just paying the price
i mean send it where it needs to go jim says
if you don't remember the place you probably know the country
where is  
afghanistan
dad
dad
i'm sorry rubai
fear blinds people
but you can see
i am not your enemy
know
but i'm not good at doing this
this is wrong
i'm very sorry
pathan  
not for you
to you
i said sorry
afghanistan
how are you general  
not good want destruction
hindustan will not give up kashmir general
so
shall we teach a lesson  
the missile is ready
waiting for you to press the button and receive my fee
and then the explosion
general
sir
everyone in my village is suffering from a strange disease
they fell dead at once
something like an iron ball fell here no one could escape from it
where and what does it mean  
there is an afghan village 200 kilometers from here
there is a news on the local tv channel
a strange disease has spread in the whole village
its symptoms
like smallpox
it
there is no way that will happen
raktbeij
how is it raktbeij  
one is in the missile here
the other ended in hindustan
either you are a fool
or they think i'm stupid
if you want the rest of the money if you want to keep the amount you gave
then we will find out where another raktbeij came from
you may have misunderstood that i am your friend
or that i have the slightest sympathy for pakistan
or a special need for money
you don't understand me general
i am
the raktbeij (one who brings destruction like a virus)
giving up
if you want to watch a free show then why delhi  
change the coordinates
let's throw the party today in islamabad
no no no i'm very sorry do not do that
you took care of it yourself didn't you  
exactly as you told me
i don't know where this came from
looking for what  
who is behind this  
answer me
and his head
need both
how did this happen  
accept
to my house
to my afghan family
my people
our pathan
what was there  
that is what has come here now
pathan
a very bad habit
wherever a party is thrown they come even if they are not invited
accept it or not
i am your pathan
if the party is held at pathan's house
pathan will come to accept you anyway
and with firecrackers
this is a joke general
the heart of another agent of yours
fallen to an enemy
like zoya before tiger (ek the tiger movie)
then now
is the isi there for security  
or
a dating website for hindustani agents  
pathan
raza
rasa pathan
pathan jim is not one to run away
whatever
amol sir  check
can the orb be removed from the missile  
yes sir get down

the real raktbeij is not here
jim's plan is always different
where is raktbeij   what is jim's real plan  
for a traitor like you
waitwaitsergei only sergey knows
sergey
flight lt  72

spreads through ac ducts in the plane
if not
you must somehow take this detonator switch from me (if you fail it will spread)
but sad
i don't think it will be possible
captain mehra i am colonel luthra from raw
your plane has a biological weapon
that device is in the ac ducts of your plane
what
then what should i do colonel   our oil level is running low
captain this weapon is very dangerous
you take the plane away from delhi please
i found it colonel
4 minutes left
contact the minister
yes sir
there is no other way left
jai hind sir
connect me to the missile unit  ok sir
captain
we have to destroy the plane
any other way colonel
there are 300 passengers in this plane and
there are also many children
your plane is more dangerous than a nuclear bomb right now
i'm sorry we
there is no way to save you
missile control room
execute the strike protocol
kamon pathan
there is only one way now
just like you burned your scientists
vande mataram was played on the plane (indian national anthem)
then blow up those passengers
attack
the death of my family is also a sacrifice
now you donate too
farewell pathan
sir the timer has stopped
the timer has stopped sir please stop the missile
stop stop stop
ladies and gentlemen this is your captain calling
fasten seat belts we are preparing to land in delhi
you don't get this little point jim
a soldier does not ask
what the country has done for him
asking
what can he do for the country  
you don't deserve this jim
they say this is my last salutation to your mother bharata
hmm
jai hind
if there is an owner of this medal
it's just you
i have never seen a braver soldier than you in my life
mom
pathan
colonel good news
i leave
so because of me you won't have high blood pressure like a tomato again
from here your and pathan's paths diverge
thank you sir
the war is not over yet pathan
we need you me  
what did you tell us then  
a hatched egg is called a shell  
i admit i made a few mistakes pathan
but colonel luthra alone cannot save this country
neither can tiger
not even kabir (hrithik roshan/ war (2019))
and neither can pathan
we need everyone
there are many such soldiers in this land pathan
some people's bodies are injured some people's souls are damaged
but in their hearts even if they die for the country
there is a feeling
only gold can bring these broken people together pathan
burned by fire (molten gold)
then only you can do this work
sharpen them and make a sharp sword like that pathan
in front of it even the souls of the enemies are afraid
but sir in whose hand will this sword be placed  
where and how to attack with this
who decides that  
the sword is yours too
so that decision is yours
thank you thank you very much sir thank you
let's begin that's right sir
ah sorry sir
at this time i have an important appointment
with whom
it was uh with my hairdresser
do you cut your hair  
no sir
only shampoo
if you need love
i have loved (someone who knows me about love)
from anyone else except this heart
i have not taken permission
this is the skill of love
only some people know
leaving life behind
i protected even the enemy
thousands of people talking
a thousand people
we have many experiences my friend
yes my friend
thousands of people talking
we have many experiences my friend
in this way
say
can be tied
wind  
me too
god pours out prayers from the heart
when pathan came to dance my dear
he steals the occasion (the party itself)
those two promises my love
he dies on them
when pathan came to the dance my dear he stole the opportunity
those two promises my love he dies on them
how to compete  
this is what we do friends
this time that way
i will tell you
i will tell you how
how about the enemy
we will sacrifice our lives
friend this time that way
i will say
way i'll tell you
friend make a signal
a signal
i will give my heart again
again
friend make a signal
i will give my heart again
in love
intoxication
that way
a trance
it is possible
sincerely
embraces even enemies
when pathan came to the dance my dear he stole the opportunity
those two promises my love he dies on them
when pathan came to the dance my dear he stole the opportunity
those two promises my love he dies on them

i'm getting married there so
is it good  
but most of all
i'm sure you've moved on well in life and
we can keep chatting more
this is not a bunch of flowers
this is from the heart understand  
sheena is told that i will cut oki's weed on a day
heywhen i see a girl my heart dances crazy ole ole ah ha ole ole ole
let's dance to the tune
i really hope he won't come
i can't argue with that now
hello don't say that
i came here to watch a drama
thanx
whenever you want
a round of applause
friendsgive a round of applause to wrestler bhavani singh from rohtak
not that are there any of you who are multitalented  
who can come here and do something  
anyone   anyone  
o
no no not him what are you doing  
why not  
jaggi please  i'm going

now he is trying to sing a 100% sure sad song
i can't i can't take him anymore
yamma yamma yamma yamma
this is a beautiful moment
yamma yamma yamma yamma
this is a beautiful moment
this is all we have in our lives tonight
by tomorrow we will be nowhere and you will be nowhere
this is all we have in our lives tonight
by tomorrow we will be nowhere and you will be nowhere
yamma yamma yamma yamma
this is a beautiful moment
this is all we have in our lives tonight
by tomorrow we will be nowhere and you will be nowhere
this is all we have in our lives tonight
by tomorrow we will be nowhere and you will be nowhere
oh god
i can't imagine you
i honestly thought you were going to break into a sad song
i'm not a guy who does that
this crying is a waste of time and energy
this is the best feature of punjabi people
it's okay if we feel like humpty dumpty had a great fall most of all
says yamma yamma perfectly
that's it
what  
don't get married please
jaggi please don't bother me
the marriage had already been decided before coming here more
i had not planned to meet you here
life happens like that we can be friends
friends be the one to fry
i love you
you don't love me
you are shocked to hear the news of my marriage
hey i'll explain it logically
look you came to the pool took my photo
it's not love is it  
then you came to practice
i mean something like
that is not love ok
then you helped me that's a shock thank you
i believe it's something a player should do
it's not love
so my story ends here
but what happened between us  
say any one
say hook up say sex
not necessarily love yes
i am very sure
i can't be fooled
there is a lot of faith  i know
you say you know me without knowing anything about yourself
karthika give us one chance
stop this marriage nonsense what  
aren't you a minor  
no i am not a minor
also there is no marriage just for love
why is it happening  
settle down huh  
look we started out as fun
because we are in the beginning definitely
after some time let's say after 10 years
my waist will expand by 10 ahals because i have children
so yes the figure gets messed up
i don't have a problem with that i don't have a problem with that
listen well
i will be bored
he will get a little angry because he is raising the children alone
no help from my husband
he will take out his anger on her
will become an emotional person
little by little my waist will widen as it competes with the imax screen
and then after a while the hurdles of life will come
if nothing goes right there is definitely therapy yes
there is chocolate therapy and retail therapy
therapy there is therapy
try laughing with therapia
don't laugh
are you getting ready for marriage too a suicide mission  
jaggi that's how marriage happens
i know i've seen yes
is it  
but the good things did not happen between us
let's not go to what we both know well
we'll both get tired of it
so well
our story went like this short & sweet
yah
karthika if you think so then you haven't seen true love
you are duplicitous basing your philosophy on the flimsiest of things
are you asking this  
i
love you
to you
not until the end not until the time of rest
i am responsible for it for life
you look into my eyes now tell me that you love him
what is this   just
no you tell me i won't say anything
what does that mean   i don't want
why  
you are defeated
look at this i don't care about your exboyfriends or relationships
because i am number one in your life
i love you hello
can you cancel the marriage  
can you cancel the marriage please
what  
cancel the marriage how hard is that  
how can you do that if you are crazy   i say

he wrote that he would come back soon
when deiyampa goes back i have to beat myself up
it doesn't matter
i know you will understand
your story encouraged me

if not in amritsar then in chandigarh
no matter where in the world in a corner in a village i will find you because you are my destiny
i love you
listen it's a different time a different place
it's a simple wedding acceptance speech that's all
no brother don't say that
it's not just a story
there is a scene the scene of love
it was deeply rooted in my heart
i mean you came here after listening to my philosophy right  
so listen to my new video
then you will ask me to send you back to india
three months ago
it's not a big deal   i said sorry
not to tell the truth
i still feel that what i said is true
but this is not the right place not the right time and i'm sorry
forgive you

# from themagicianselephant2023srt

peter the other children have families
but as an orphan you have fewer facilities
you have to dedicate yourself to the life of a soldier
pay attention
here is the coin for today

another small fish is good to get used to being hungry
 what are we for    we are soldiers sir

can be created by a human heart or mind
answers are given at the cost of one coin
one coin
i want to know
wow
your guardian vilna lats will be angry if you go without dinner
where are you from how do you know that  
but you have to find answers
do you go without food for a day or do you spend your life without answers

nonsense you deliberately crushed my legs an elephant
not it should have joined
lilies yes that's it
 a bunch of lilies  hey what is this  
no idea that's awesome remove now
back off wizard
i'm just an entertainer
i didn't have fun

i will make it so
chest forward shoulder back take a breath
direct but polite firmly but respectfully
great work
duchess she is fair and wise
no one remembers the last time he smiled
 he can sing  can you sing  
sh yes captain martini  
thank you duchess
i came to ask where the elephant is
who sent you to ask  
have you been contacted by a foreign power  
not as the captain of the palace security i want to know
the elephant is dangerous we don't know where she came from
aliya is a criminal and she is treated as such
a criminal   not
 this must be a barrier opening  what  
we must hope that more animals will come
camels the cassowaries crocodiles
we ordered the wizard to make her disappear but he said no
so we planned to destroy him
i didn't decide that
if a boy hits a rock with a glass do you blame the rock  
we are talking about an elephant
 you are talking about a murderer  the elephant committed a crime
the elephant is not guilty of anything except being an elephant
i will talk about this again tomorrow
but let me tell you captain martini
i take the safety of our city very seriously
he needs to get out of here
agreed
the only good solution
very ok
now leo martini saw it differently
keep the elephant alive
the king
ah
he knows two things
 huh    one the king has never been to the baltics
beyond the castle wall landing safely…
that's impossible i love it
two the king likes to have fun
just have fun
never have fun
i love you sir
hey who likes yogurt   who needs yogurt  
another doctor then do it again great work
an elephant came out of the ceiling and hit an old woman
are you kidding   let's go
the king
his highness wants
see the elephant
 to the king    coming here  
 see the elephant    excellent
 we must prepare  other things too

no thanks ma'am
 ah  the child has great courage
i want to tell aliya to find my lost sister that's my destiny
destiny
i want to ask you for him
the elephant is very dangerous peter it can't be done
i like impossible things
hey what if peter did three impossible things
instead of one  
we are here for three days
every day i choose something that a child cannot do
if he does all three if he proves his courage and strength
he gets the elephant
or i'll take her with me
ok i'm not sure
it's a deal you are wonderful duchess
i like this place a lot more
ok the first thing that can't be done
a battle
 a fight    yes
who doesn't like a fight  
besides an impossible battle is the best right  
 by reason sir  the child is ready for it i mean
right   he has some ideas about the elephant
 more fate  ah
i love it ok tomorrow at noon the child will fight with my best soldier
come on
 pistol or sword  um
swords i love this baby give him my sword henry
this is yours
if you don't get killed you know i'll take it back
peter did you practice swordsmanship  
 no sir a little broom handle  hmm
meet me at the store if you like i'll try to teach you
tomorrow noon
stop
cheat
ok
be safe
attack
hmmm
strike back
ok
 i'm getting better  definitely
ah crazy how does the boy win  
what if he wins  
what if  
your what if is the end of us leo martini
i'm sorry ma'am but how can two small words be dangerous  
it is in the hands of leo martini
what if we use our savings to raise goats  
best pet
if she could be trained not to eat the floor and walls
what if we bring rare things from the far east  
it should have been okay
unless the entire ship was eaten by pygmy goats
they didn't eat the silk
ah yes silk
did you see the silk roll  
my husband wanted to use it to kill himself
it's called a parafoot and there's evidence that it works
 did it ever work    not
actually the results are a little scary that's true
but what if i was the first  
i go and train with the fake guy
good boy
wow wow
a tireless and kind person
 leo  but he has no one to love
don't say that
we were alone on the deck below
not we tried and failed
god did not plan children for us leo martini
who are we to talk about what god has planned  
please
my heart has been broken many times
it can't handle your stupid questions
but how   how will the world change if we don't question it  
the world cannot be changed
the world is always as it is
not
i don't believe it
here for peter in front of us
we are being asked to make a difference

hmm do you think elephants have names  
yes every animal has a name

elephants also dream
elephant's dream with his family

in a place he knows where he likes
he definitely does not belong here
everything seems impossible

the former king himself
a good day to see a child fly isn't it   there is not a cloud in the sky
something like that
it's a shame really
because you know brown skin
i couldn't stop
am i still the king   did i miss something  
has he ever smiled  
never  
ever  
ever since his brother died in the war
my goodness
ok
they said that the elephant will come here do you see sister

ok good
ok the third impossible thing
ah
i haven't received one yet
not i'm the king of the time zone you know  
i said something like i was flying didn't i  
always do
that's funny god but
aha
no no no back off son
i do this when i feel like saying something great
okay baby ready  
the third impossible thing
you must make the duchess laugh
what
what
ah
they work hard for it
an impossible task is something that people try to do  
i no the middle part inside something
ok i have no idea but that means
can't do it
besides this kid is a genius
if anyone thinks better than this child
he is the next one to tie a tent and jump over the church
remember that
stop worrying about the baby and find out who's going to bring me an ice cream
one that tastes good
anyone   hello   why are we all standing here  
ah adele
my god
hello
this is me came from a dream you remember  
i am back can you tell me why  
this is really impossible
i mean he never smiled
never
maybe they'll let me jump over the church again
i can write a joke
sorry  
maybe you're not that funny
ok i'm sure you're a joke
come on
come on
excuse me miss
i don't usually say insulting things like that
besides i have never hit anyone in my life
excuse me please
 but i  here i am
i searched everywhere
are you okay  
they are sisters
now you have seen the elephant
hello madam
did he tell you anything  
not
good dear
now we can go home
but sister
let's sleep well and go back to where we belong
hmm
i get confused sometimes peter
ambiguity about some things
i want to tell you
very clear to me
what i have to tell you now
you are right
he lived
the little girl lived
i could have saved him
i left him with the nurse
we were supposed to meet at the camp but there was a big explosion
i i didn't think i could take care of you both
i'm a soldier peter
what do i know about a baby  
we make these decisions
in war in real life
we have little time
i could have saved you both
i didn't
i lied
because i didn't want to hurt you
i'm sorry
sir
did you see him die  
my sister
not
then anything can happen
this is
you talked about impossible elephants
you are right
sir  
you were up against an unbeatable opponent
you won it
so today
i saw you fly
you are my child
you
you are the one who can do it
tomorrow is one more task
okay tell me a joke
a horse went to a bar maybe she couldn't get in
no no it's not a joke
not
ah
yes
ok laughing at that
madam la vaughan
i lied to you
ah
finally accepted
not i didn't mean to harass you or bring an elephant
but i did not make it to bring a bunch of lilies
hmm
as i stood on that stage looking at you
your disbelief
it broke my heart
even now even if you see an illusion in front of you
never mind
master arts broken magic work done mistakes but
an illusion
you responded stop as if you were being bullied
what happened there  
that night i tried to cast a spell for you and the others there
an illusion that will make you believe again
think of illusions
because extraordinary things can be done
if you believe
but it is not for me to do such a powerful magic
because i'm not a very good magician
i tried magic and wonder
it was a disaster
i know
i know you're worried about the duchess's smile
but i have a good joke
i will take care of it you believe me
hey
i feel like you don't take me seriously i am dangerous
i defeated a giant jumped off a building
ok ok there's plenty of time to joke about it later
let's focus on our last work but…
i can't wait to get you out of here
let's have a lot of fun do a lot of heroics
find my sister
hmm
wow
go
woohoo
wow
is this your family
peter
peter
peter peter peter
peter
peter
hey get up now is the time
everyone came and peter your third job
this would be great
ah
you must miss them i thought you would take me to my family
i want to take you to your family
time to do the third impossible thing
will the child finally win the elephant  
yes i'm doing
now as soon as i heard the duchess laugh
you take the elephant
kick off
once upon a time there was a farmer and a fisherman
 they went on a trip together  a good start great
they heard the sound of a laughing toad
when they looked towards the pond they saw a hen
the hen took this piece of thread
he puts the piece of string in his mouth and takes it out
of the frog in the pond
the string is put up and down in the toad's mouth
the fisherman said why do you think hens do this  
the farmer turned to the fisherman and said
of course always the same question isn't it  
huh   huh  
why do hens dig toads' teeth  
awesome great peter funny story
ah i understand
why chickens   it's like
wait wait
it's not a real smile
if you don't take this seriously what's the point  
sorry kid you failed
peter
not
what not  
you have to let me have him
not for me but for him
all this time i was trying to win the elephant and find my family
but he also has a family and he is separated from them
peter what about your sister  
aliya also has a sister
why is my person more important  
i know the joke didn't work
but please the elephant did not come here of his own free will
we need to send him home
no no no no no no
kids you touch me a little more
but no
you could have done one thing but i don't see him smiling
get the elephant we're going now
no no no
ok i know this can't happen
but what if it wasn't like that  
think about it
think about all the impossible things you've done
you have done a lot
have you done any of them yourself  
definitely not that's nonsense
peter fought the mother against the king
maybe he will feel lonely
but he is not like that
no one is like that remember
let's go
come on
i am
okay kid you did it
what really  
but the elephant did it
he's smiling isn't he   that's all i wanted
things cannot be done until they are done
the elephant is yours peter
what
a real win
ok woohoo
ok
wow
we did it we did it
hmm wow
how do we send him home  
a ferry across the sea
a spaceship  
let's use the big elephants and take them up the mountains
until i said it i thought it was good
wizard
get up now
this boy says that the elephant should go home
you have to make him disappear
you saw what happened when i was trying to cast spells
we're lucky it wasn't severe
sir the elephant should be with his family
yes that's a good idea but look around you
all my illusions fail
 failed    i can't do it
nonsense
you brought an elephant here from the roof
don't you realize that started something here  
what you wish for
hey wizard let's send this big guy home
i'm sure you can do the magic you want
i am sure only you can fix everything
sister sister
sister please
in my dreams i could have followed him
i don't believe in dreams
you believe
i believe i believe in dreams
a lot
something is happening
must join the war
hey no problem
it doesn't matter
i heard it used to be different here
there was light there was life there was hope
a city of the best kind can make an elephant disappear
this is my house
but not his
losing a friend is hard
we have to say goodbye now
the wizard brought him here
i am sure he can send him back
are you sure  
that's how this can be done
please sir
confidence is a great intangible
it comes like sleep
we get stuck sometimes
fighting in ways we can't name
finally sleep
until we are conquered
we stop and then we heal
the elephant is missing
i can't believe i saw magic
 what's up    look at the clouds
it's an illusion
everything becomes clear
 what is that    that sun my dear
it is good
it's beautiful
sunlight
you were destined to follow him
this is more important
come on adele time to go home
sir you are out
yes yes
ah
ah
the soldier  
you died
you died
you  
you say
baby boy
peter
this this is my sister
 you are right
 first let me tell you  you're alive here
family
peter
awesome
good good
ah
ok
found him
come on why is that  
no more jumping off buildings
the magic worked
i'm sorry to trouble you ma'am
i beg your pardon
lilies
thank you friend
now look at this place
reinvigorated in the city do you see
you'll be here for a while
i know but every time i try to leave
it's just impossible
then maya coral got up
the oysters jumped and screamed
going demon spawn
to the sky
 it's very scary  thank you
a complete family was created
how do you find foreign threads  
i have my secrets you know   i am from a big city
say you don't make pajamas for goats anymore they eat them
yes but he likes to eat pajamas
come eat hot
meanwhile the elephant
he lived a long time
time to test an elephant's memories
but of course he never forgot peter
i mean how  

# from thepaleblueeye2022websrt
the line between life and death is rough and fuzzy who can tell the end of one and the beginning of the other    ea po
good morning gentlemen
 are you augustus landor    i am
and you  
at your service captain hitchcock second commanding officer of the academy
i came to inform you
superintendent thayer requested to see you immediately
 need to meet    i'll let the colonel tell it
 when will this meeting take place    as soon as you can
what if i decide not to come  
it's your choice you are a private citizen
this is the day he was told to go on a trip
hudson valley new york 1830
the governor says you're a legend
among the policemen of new york
when he recommended your services he spoke of your charming skills
including capturing the leader of the daybreak boys
smashing the dreaded shirttail gang
and about solving the unimaginably difficult mystery of the death of aliciane field a young courtesan
your abilities include riot control law breaking
and harsh interrogations
you are the son of a gloucester priest
came to new york at a very young age
and your wife is dead mr landor
three years now
 shall i send you coffee    a beer would be nice
you
do you keep these notes in the back of a little cage  
what else do they say  
did they say that i did not darken the door of a church  
a long time ago  
did it say that my daughter ran away a while ago  
we are aware of your daughter's disappearance
we are sorry about that
respectfully i did not insult you
no no no no
not sorry i must apologize
i will do you keep saying it
mr landor we've had to work on our wits
we are looking for someone
one citizen well qualified
a test can be done on behalf of the academy
haha
a very complex and delicate nature here
and one thing happened to one of our cadets
a sophomore from kentucky named fry
 leroy frye  there is no point in dancing around it now
fry hanged himself last night
ah
i'm sorry to hear about that
this is a terrible incident but you must understand our situation
we have been specially assigned to look after these young men
make them good gentlemen and soldiers and eventually we'll get them out
but we like to think we know when to stop giving them
a boy hangs himself
that sounds like a coroner's question
i'm sorry that's not the end of it
cadet fry's body was taken from the hospital last night and mutilated
distorted   who
if we knew that we wouldn't need to call you here
i'm sure there's a joker in the academy
this is no joke mr landor
leroy frye's heart was ripped out of his chest
dr marquis how does one do such a thing  
surgical knife or it could be a sharp knife
but winning the heart is a difficult task
these lesions in the lungs and kidneys
what has happened is that by tilting the knife do not injure the heart
how does one take care of the heart  
in something like a box
wrapped in cotton cloth or newspaper
often put in ice
what kind of person does this  
a strong person
not a woman then  
no woman i've ever met can do this
how is his medical knowledge  
does he need to know better or practice like you  
not necessary
he wants a big field he wants to know where to cut
but he doesn't have to be a doctor or a surgeon
 he must be  crazy
still out there
arms forward
i'm sorry mr landor
you meet us at a very delicate moment
to the left
there are very powerful congressmen in washington
waiting to see us fail and shut us down
i ask you to uphold the honor of the united states military academy
save it i'll try
you mr huntoon were on security duty last night
yes sir
work started at 9:30 freed at midnight and then i went back to the security room
where is that
number four sir near fort clinton
i i admit i don't know much about the land
but apparently that's where we stand now
not the road from fort clinton to north camp
 no sir  why did you go the other way  
sir while i was going i heard something
i thought it was an animal
it sounded like dying or being trapped and eating so i came to help
i am very fond of animals
as i ran this way i saw cadet fry sir
 how did he look    not well sir
he was not hanging straight
he almost seems to be sitting in a chair
i didn't understand you
his feet were on the ground sir
 his legs were on the ground    yes sir
ok what did you do next  
i ran ran back towards the northern camp
hmm
ah last question won't bother you again
did you see anyone else  
no sir
mr huntoon
neck
that is the first problem
did you see
this is not the right volume the rope is after his crotch
it has gone up and down along the neck
like
like he fought
hmm  
look at his fingers if you will
new blisters came and pulled the cord
trying to get it away from him
may i ask what is going on here  
this is very unusual
i thought you wouldn't mind rubbing the back of mr fry's head
you examined mr fry didn't you  
of course i checked him out as is my job
hmm
we've done this before haven't we  
 uh  hmm
there is a kind of bruise here
in the lateral section (ismudun area)
approximately three inches
 i must have missed it  hmm
someone killed mr fry
that's what you're telling us isn't it mr landor  
you're on to something here captain hitchcock
anyone can miss it doctor
mr landor
now that you're involved in this
i think it would be better if we set some rules
you must report to me during the day i will report to the colonel
you can't tell anyone about this inside or outside the academy
 is that all    last condition
drinking alcohol is prohibited until this test is over
you are famous for it
ah
sorry
 are you augustus landor    yes
if i'm not mistaken you have been assigned to solve the mystery
related to leroy frye
that's how it is what do you want me to do for you  
this is a duty assigned to me and an honor to the institution
revealing to you some conclusions that i have come to
conclusions  
concerning the late mr fry
i am very interested
the man you are looking for
a poet
the soldiers are in kochrane
when leroy fry's body was brought back to the hospital
were you deployed to protect it  
yes sir
 did something happen under your protection    not until 2:30
 that's when i was released from my duties  who freed  
 soldier who freed you    i can't say that sir
he only knows that he is an officer
 didn't you say who he was    no sir
but i don't expect that from an officer
hmm
what did the officer tell you  
he said thank you soldier that's all for now i'll release you
 that's a strange request isn't it    yes sir a lot
 did you see the officer's face    no sir
i only had a candle it was very dark that day
ok tell me then how do you know it's an officer  
the belt on his shoulder sir but i have to admit it was also very strange
 how    belt
his left shoulder strap was missing
ah here he comes
benny can tell exactly when he sees someone if he wants a drink
seeing this also warms my blood
 benny  sir
 here to the rules  executors
patsy
patsy
what are you sad about  
did you hear about the poor soldiers  
 they say it took hours to die  they  
this one
you should be in singing class right  
ah good evening music  
not it's okay without me
they know i'm in the academy
also i learned more in rooms like this than in classes
i have no dispute about it
sit down please sit down take take
 a seat    a seat thank you
fourth class po ea po
edgar a po
like from the big thirties
it helps to lose weight
hmm
so tell me how did you know about leroy frye  
a from huntoon definitely
he scatters the news like lamenting
maybe someone will hang him before too long
did you mean someone hanged mr fry  
i didn't mean to say anything
why do you think the one who took out leroy frye's heart  
a poet  
this is
the heart is a symbol otherwise it is useless
now remove the code what do you have  
a handful of flesh no beauty like a lump of urine
now removing a man's heart is a strange sign
who can do such a thing
except for a poet  
a poet with confused thoughts i think
you can't pretend this is a beast
it's like echoing in the recesses of your mind
a song of a milkdrinking god
i'm sorry give me back my heart because i can't have yours
or as in the bible
my god cleanse my heart
a broken and contrite heart neither leans nor bows
then we are easily looking for a religious fanatic
no you see i omitted to tell you that i am a poet too
why would you like to think so  
i don't understand much poetry
why   you are american
and you  
an artist that means without a country
 uh  what mr landor  
you were a great help
it would be good if you had a second look at sebela loughborough
back in the day leroy was fry's roommate until a fight broke them up
the nature of such things is unbelievable
mr loughborough
tell mr landor how you know mr fry
yes sir we were roommates
hmm
did you guys break up in a fight  
i don't mean that i broke up with a fight just
the reason for the different paths sir
 why did you go a different way    this is
no big deal
general events
if you know anything about mr fry
reveal it now
it's like this sir
i mean he joined
to a bad gang
at least that's what he told them
now tell me what a bad gang means
about the other cadets  
he never said but i thought so
why didn't you reveal this earlier  
i didn't really see that it was related to this
it happened a long time ago sir
walk out
mr stoddard
you were the last to see mr fry alive
yes sir
 speak loudly  i'm a little sick sir
i saw leroy late on the day in question
i passed him when i entered the camp
did you talk to him
he stopped me and asked if there were officers inside
how does mr fry look  
it was a very dark time i i don't trust my memories
did you see anything with him maybe a long rope  
 i don't see names  hmm
there was something there ah
as fry left i asked where he was going at a time like that
so  
he said an imperative duty
what did you understand by that  
i don't know
walk out
 sorry captain  yes
almighty god
a cow and a sheep slaughtered and cut to pieces at cold springs
their chests were brutally opened and their hearts removed
will any of god's creatures survive this guy  
we don't know if this is the same man
what
coincidental events  
with effect from 0600 tomorrow morning
all people participate only in classes meals and prayers
nothing else can
if any of your classmates ask
we didn't do anything else except talk about your relationship with leroy frye
no relation i don't even know him
 what    i don't know him
 then i misunderstood you  haha you are not the first
so if this isn't a discussion what is  
an invitation to a job
there is no payment in this
none of your friends will know what you are doing
it's been a long time since you did that
if they find out they will curse your name
ah an inevitable proposition
no please tell me more
great i want to solve this part of this larger post
you must work in secret as carefully as possible
i would like to report that i have successfully resolved your message
hmm written by hand it is personal in nature
fry held this at the time of his death
from that we assume it should be enough
take him out of the camp on that fateful night
as the remainder of this message is torn from his hand
we can imagine that this note in some way refers to the person who sent it
using black traditional capital letters like this one
clearly the sender wanted to hide his identity
something like an invitation or should we say more accurately a trap
a trap  
hmm
 now with that in mind shall i show    hmmmmm
let's pay attention to the third line
we know for a fact that it is complete
be what is that (be)
anything that starts with an l
little   lucky   (little lucky)
not nothing matches the invitation
get lost   no no too rude (be lost)
if we expect the arrival of leroy frye in this at some time and place
can be one word late
be late
when we look at the third line
the first word is quite easily defined don't
so don't be late (don't be late)
now look carefully mr landor
we don't have to go far to find the right person
if fry goes to a place he already knows
he from the writer's point of view is coming
so come mr fry (come mr fry)
now with it in hand it becomes much simpler
find the next word could it be anything other than soon   (soon)
if we insert that word
don't be late come quickly (don't be late come soon)
here you go the solution to our puzzle
 respectfully submitted  hmmmmm
first class work i am thankful
 one thing  yes
any luck with the first two lines  
i decided to give it up
do you know letters well  
exactly it has been decided
father john bransby of stoke nevinton
so i think you have done what many of us have done
similar words are misspelled
for example they're their and there
a common slang term
definitely an invitation meet me (meet me there)
of course we still don't know where to meet do we  
anything ending in ng
landing place (the landing)
 i should add port of landing  good choice
so i will be at the landing port (i'll be at the cove by the landing)
meet me there around 11:00 pm
so don't be late come and meet me can be very similar
 yes  ah
does this make any sense to you  
why he meets a fellow cadet at the port
 where possible    hmm
because that is not a cadet she is a woman
hmm
you always knew the answer mr landor
i had an idea
if we are definitely looking for a woman
i believe i have been fortunate enough to see him
the day after leroy fry's death before i knew what had happened
i woke up read the opening lines of a poem
in those lines there was a mysterious woman who was deeply saddened
then outside the dining hall i saw the most beautiful creature in the world
i was lucky enough to see it with my own eyes
who is she
i am not weak
but why do you believe this poem or woman is related to mr fry  
unspoken violence
unspeakable tension
an unknown woman
you can wake up any morning and write this
but i didn't write it i read to write
 read    hmmmm
who
my mother
he is dead
about 20 years ago
tell me about this po boy
ah po he
a beloved child
beautiful rituals talking a lot
definitely there is definitely something strange about him
because he talks a lot  
no because he's full of mindless nonsense
i was told in a poem
in connection with the death of leroy frye
it was told to him in his sleep by his dead mother
out of everyone you know the ones we're missing
always with us
people do a lot of things to cheat death doesn't he  
in a box of sorts
wrapped in cotton maybe newspaper
often with ice
good you got my note
 did someone follow you    followed  
how ugly no time
 what is this    crime scene
secondcrime
where fry's heart was brought
you said that taking fry's heart led you to the bible
i must admit i was also on my way there
not to the bible
but to religion
this this seems like a kind of sacrifice
place blood and candles in a deliberate order
 a circle  hmm another triangle
and fry's heart must have been kept inside a lot of the time
i have an old friend i can use
professor john pepe is an expert on code
 pepe  offerings
 mysterious secrets  professor
pepe by far
 a very different person  come in i am here
 sorry for interrupting  i am happy to come
i brought something interesting i would like you to look at it
ah
this can only be magic
i remember seeing it in the book the real red dragon
if i remember correctly there was a magician standing
in the middle of the triangle
alone  
he must have a team of assistants
more candles and torches everywhere light everywhere
a festival of lights of sorts
long if you could go to the third shelf
the second one from the top
the book on top
ok ok
pierre de lancey champion witch hunter
 do you speak french mr poe    yes
please read quietly it's on the middle page
de lancey killed 600 witches
left behind let us read this unique book
but the book i would like to give you is the devil's tales by henry le clarke
who had killed 700 witches before him
it is known to have been destroyed
now there are rumors that he has left behind two or three books
identical in all respects to the destroyed one
finding one of them became the sole purpose of occult collectors
 why    why   ah
le clark wrote instructions how to protect
immortality
my goodness
evil gods are generally known among sects
about what is contained in the uposatha ceremony of witches
they are limited with the following
unclean animals for example christians do not eat
hearts of unbaptized children
and the hearts of hanged men
i want you to sneak into the cadets
go and find out who has connections with such sects
tell me who are you
i have a suggestion to make
a bit of a dark i must say unchristian proposition
 nonchristian    yes
i have had questions even about the basics of my faith
and in the ancient origins the supernatural and the occult are barely explored
 occult activities    he means dark magic who is that
i want to know
i cannot reveal his name
who is he
you can't take it from me
even if god himself came and threatened to strike me with lightning
 if you want to join our prayers  no i'll give you my word
 if someone questions your beliefs  that's my personal thing
is that the marquis  
hamilton take care
yes i got a name but i need a face to go forward
 vertigo hmm    hmm
everything revolves around
your heart rate is too fast
well mr poe stay home today
take care of yourself and rest
give this to lt locke and his commander
artemis my son
he will take care keep you away from duties
you want to walk out of class because you feel like it
a whirlwind  
even if the balance is written even more chaotic
a big shock
a state of shock  
in a clearly visible character
take care poe
it is better if you ask the doctor himself
that's true lieutenant
my father told me that he had never seen anything like this
good
but i am punishing you for being obscenely stubborn
three points are subtracted
go back to your room
also you better be there when the officers come to check
 poe right    yes
artimus marquis
i must say i admire your stubbornness
tonight 11 o'clock 18th north camp
sorry for my delay i hope you were not kept too long
this is beautiful
books
never been so interested in you
where to start   ah
poor fenimore cooper i think every library should have one
ah what a collection
egyptian history all kinds
found you
eh  
you made me think that you don't read poetry
not so
byron
 a personal favorite mr landor  please
i must say a good collection
it's my daughter's
is your daughter not here anymore  
not not he ran away with someone
do you know someone  
on the way
will he never come back  
it looks like that
then we are both alone in this world
but you have your mother
he's still talking to you
 in a way  yes
yes from time to time
i must say if there is any good in me as a man as a soul it came from him
your daughter what is his name if you don't like it
mathilda
matty
you need say no more mr landor
 so you said you found someone  not something better than that
a man appeared by the name of marquis
dr
no his son artemis
i accepted a job to join his impenetrable team
here is another good animal of god
courtesy from the divine patsy
are you reporting us for breaking curfew po  
do our sins offend you  
and i don't mind mr ballinger but hmm
another round has been ordered

everything woman
ballinger you're really annoying tonight
hmm

i thank you
hmm
 i can do this all night  uhhuh
hern ballinger
i took great pains to protect it
po
i understand you are a poet
i was told i was getting a gift
then i ask for a public reading
 make us happy  ah
i met a naked prostitute in bermuda
discreet she thought
i'm more discerning than that
she thought it was indecent to make love naked
i chased her restrained her caught her
great po
great
losing card seven
the winning card is the donkey
ah
ok ok ok it's your lucky day po
thank you
is it true poe that detective landor questioned you about fry  
he misunderstood that i had a friendship with fry
really you
i'm not like that
fittingly it's all fry has to do to get attention
death by hanging
i think he hanged himself out of desperation caused by a fickle woman
what woman could that be stoddard  
what about your sister artemis  
did he fool fry  
hey randy
you were closer to fry than anyone in this room
i can't believe i was near him
like you
ok where were we
stop
don't you have a curfew mr poe  
you answer
the candles should have been extinguished three hours ago
i'm sorry sir
your apologies always left me feeling empty
leroy fry met his killer when he was out after curfew
go back to camp now
you are lucky not to be cut in their graves
thank you sir
hasten the step
matty  
remember me for good things god
you are not commemorated in death
who will thank you at your grave  
by your pardon
remember me for my good
my eyes are worn out with sorrow
are you mr landor  
i am
i am leroy's mother
i would like you to take this
leroy's diary
it's at least three years old
i do not remember
i'm very sorry
a great sadness
i don't remember that he had a diary of his personal things
it was sent to me by mr ballinger
 mr ballinger    yes
as soon as he heard what had happened
he went straight to leroy's room to see what was going on
dear boy this is mailed to me
i can see
now as soon as he saw me
he said i thought leroy's diary was with you in kentucky
burn it if you feel like it by all means
how much does he think  
but i don't see the point
all numbers and letters
but seeing that the army depends on you
i thought it was only right that you take this
i will always come to see you
 fulfill her needs  i understand
 because we are all in this together
doctor
ah mr landor what a wonderful surprise
please allow me to introduce my wife julia
i have heard a lot about you
it's a pleasure
aren't you the gentleman investigating mr fry's death  
i am
we were talking about this
definitely my husband told me
mr fry's body is too much to put on public display
hmm
his poor parents
definitely
these incidents have scared us
responsible means i will not rest until i catch him
nice to meet you
dayabari
i understand you are a widower mr landor
that's right
with appropriate regrets
soon   did your wife go to get her present  
two years ago
it has been a few months since we came to these mountains
a sudden illness right  
not suddenly
enough
your sacrifices are in my heart
 sorry  thank you
hmm
great
edgar didn't i tell you my sister was a veteran  
great my dear brought a tear to my eye
yes
dear play miss marquis
 really  yes
your immortality is sure
i can't imagine any woman hoping for immortality randy  
i once remembered something sir thomas gray said
bloom so many flowers are born that they cannot be seen
and its taste is wasted in the desert
a favorite mr poe
what do you think of my little keeper  
i think mr poe is too good to be anyone's protector
he must not be corrupted by people like you
well written
that's enough rest before you eat dinner
 if you will allow me gentlemen  thank you leah
randy chairs
stoddart come on chess board
ok i'm bored now
i don't care he is sick
under his condition he can't have much fun
miss marquis
or i'm sorry
nothing makes me happier than meeting you on saturday
i think that's true mr poe but i have work on saturday
ah is that so  
your coat and hat sir
thanks eugenia you don't have to do this
i could have gone and got these myself
 good evening  good evening
looks like you know french mr poe
such a style of speech is very beautiful
so your proposal is on saturday  
or sunday if that's good
or monday is fine
where are you going to hold this meeting  
i will think where to read   or the coalburning council  
no no no no
neither of those
on my mind the cemetery
 the cemetery    hmm
very fun
yes i think so too
i wish you a good evening
everything is bearable now
but to enjoy the mountains in their full glory
it should be seen as soon as the leaves fall
why is that  
the plants have not grown too much
but it interferes with god's creation
dear
you like to talk about god and death don't you  
i think death is a very sublime poetry
shall we sit down  
 a lovely place  yes this is my favorite place
how do you feel about being sick  
it fits better than your uniform
artemas is the only ear for you
i have never seen him reign in a kingdom full of sorrow
he is allowed to come into our world for a long time
you know i believe i can dance on broken glass
normal time
not always
yes i see a lot of similarities between you two
i hope you are not cold
this cold weather must be good
oh not for us
don't think i came here to talk about the weatherhow normal
i'm very sorry my only goal was your comfort
then do it by all means
tell me your undying love and we both might not be the worst after we go home
 i mean  i'm sorry
sorry i'm horrible but i don't know why
you are cold
miss marquis would you like to put on my coat  
 that's fine  i really
i am
 what   — miss marquis
leah leah
leah written   what's happening  
leah
wrote down
my god leah
are you ok
 leah    i am very good
are you sure you're okay   i was very scared
it happens there is nothing to worry about
your
your heart encourages me so i feel free to confess
my mother is in my life in a way
in my sleep and wakefulness
yes yes
always i believe death scares us because we love them so much less
we forget them we don't think but we do
i believe they feel cruelly abandoned so they clamor for us
maybe it's better if we don't think too much about it
i just want to tell you how grateful i am…
when i opened my eyes you were there
look deep within yourself
find something i never expected
even in thousands of years
thank you
stop
thieves need to know where their kehelmal is
staying away from leah
drop
giving up ballinger
or work against you
ugly shit
are you ok
obviously the animal knows that leah likes me more than him
 if he is trying to scare me away  scared  
 apparently he tried to kill you  kill me   ah
ah no before i let him come between my heart and me
i will kill him
it's always been this way people underestimate me
friends classmates my best friend
 thanks patsy  everyone
everyone
but my dear mother is not like that
thanks for helping me earlier
i don't usually get caught like that
you were surprised too isn't that right landor  
i have no desire to attack
but you are more learned than you are now
now tell me is it true that one time you asked for a confession  
with a look like throwing a stone  
be patient
the suspect himself tortures him
you are the most beautiful companion landor
i will write a poem about it one day
your name has been around for years
even after this attack you don't suspect randy ballinger  
where does this take you  
your test
i am interested in artimus marquis
does that mean you know him  
who doesn't know  
he looks glorious
he has to die young right  
but i don't see him as violent
always very good
maybe he is not our person
he has quality to his whole family
they act like they are guilty of something
aren't all families guilty of something  
 captain  that's mr ballinger
i am sorry to say he is missing
beyond those rocks
look this way too
on the mountain
cadets right side behind those trees
there is nothing here
kapinat up here
my god
mr ballinger's cut is not as sharp as fry's
it is suggested that this is done in a different way
like a cut
i am
a cut  
god landor
we are not responsible for this
than we were a month ago
we are near
 the time has come  tell me
did you find any more evidence of this satanic work  
what happens to the person who claimed to be an officer met by cadet cochrane
leroy fry's secrets abandoned  
or fry's diary  
did you find a single piece of evidence  
one madman roams free beneath these mountains ripping the guts out of my people
people do their work less now rarely come out of the camp or sleep
if they can sleep so will their guns
i'm going to believe you don't think i'm worthy anymore
to do this test
thank you doctor
our problem is not your ability but your obedience
is there any chance this could be mr poe's work  
po  
yesterday he read to his friends
like a heroic deed about a fight he had with mr ballinger
pili has confessed that he wanted to kill him
if they have a sword fight again
you've seen poe
can you honestly say he killed ballinger  
not there is no need there the firearm will do the job
whatever his relationship with ballinger
there is no sign of a relationship between poe and leroy frye
 they don't even know each other  but they know
they had a separate fight last summer
i don't think he ever gave that information did he  
then arrest him
if you are so sure get arrested
we only have his purpose
we ask you to provide evidence
mr landor don't you have a secret hatred for this academy  
isn't it  
i risked my life for your precious institution
but yes
i believe that the academy is disenfranchising young people
it binds them with rules
losing their cause losing their humanity
are you saying that the academy should be held responsible for these deaths  
someone connected to the academy yes that is the academy itself
that's funny
but according to you
every crime a christian commits is a stain on jesus
so that's it
when i first asked you to accept this job
you told me you never had any contact with leroy frye
let's start there right  
 that's not entirely true  okay okay
why aren't your things simple po  
where are your facts where are your simple facts  
yes or no
the truth
 do you know leroy frye    yes
did you have a word with leroy frye  
yes yes
did you kill leroy frye  
did you kill randolph ballinger  
not
did you have anything to do with cutting up their bodies  
 no no no lightning struck my head i  but you don't deny it
did you threaten them both  
as for ballinger it's
i didn't mean it
 and fry    i never threatened him i'm a little
there's a very disturbing order here poe
the people you fight are staying in the wrong place
or taken from their chest without vital organs
mr landor
if i kill every cadet
for the abuse i received during the short time i was here
you will see the cadet group here
less than a dozen
if you must know i was a joke
since the first day i came here
my customs my age my behavior
my beauty
if i had a thousand lives
i can't even begin to speak to my wounds
they have done to me
yes i regret many many big things but never this
not for murder
do you believe me now  
i believe you should be careful in what you say and do
for now i can pretty much stop hitchcock
but if you lie to me again
they can lock you in irons and i won't lift a finger to help you
do you understand me
if you'll let me i have to go to dinner
thank you for joining us in mourning the untimely passing of randolph
that dear child is like a family member
don't you think my son is particularly handsome mr landor  
hmm
it seems to me that both your children have been blessed in that regard
yes we have been blessed for generations
but i have to say you seem like a rare person to me
a very intelligent person
such quality is rarely seen here
with that intelligence mr landor
i think when your legal duty is over
i hope you will help me solve my own puzzle
 ah a puzzle    a strange request
on monday during playtime
looks like someone messed with my stuff
 ah  this is
 there are sweet people too  really dad  
i lean towards one theory that person is simply cruel
of course he doesn't even know who he is
of all things you must be careful artemis
 definitely  ah mother
it is an old friend who has been bored many times
someone who has nothing good to do and no life to call his own
someone who lives in a wooden cabin of the vulgar class
isn't that right mr landor  
ah
 you also have a wooden cabin don't you    artemis
you probably have a very close relationship about this
maybe a dear friend who likes to go to a bar and drink often
stop it oh i don't like it
i can't stand it when you talk like this
 i don't understand your intention mother  ah you don't understand
i want to go the other way nobody's business
no one understands
 isn't that right daniel    son please
you guys forgive my wife
death of mr ballinger
brought a dark streak to our happy little gang
i suppose you would like to come into my office mr landor  
i am happy
i'm sorry constable
living on pins and needles has become a big pain for us
 no need to apologize  yes
at this time of year every confinement
hmm everything is clear
i can't stop seeing doctor
is your daughter sick  
good observation
yes
yes he
he has had a hard time because of it
in fact since he was a child
when no one sees his terrible illness
his brain shuts down and he shakes like a pod
a beautiful child
a child of marriageable age
that disability illness
it's dangerous
gentlemen leah is in good shape if you join us
thank you son
shall we go
if you don't mind i'll go outside for a bit and get some fresh air
definitely
daddy play with me
should i try again with wyatthu  
or is this time something more challenging  
 terrible  slightly
normal maybe
you don't understand the effect your playing has on me
for all of us really i…
 really    i am
i don't really know how to say it but i understand
that i would do anything for you
ah edgar
may i help you find mr landor  
you are well very soon
forgive me
i was afraid that i would get that terrible migraine
but what i need is to take a little rest
i feel much better now
let's forget that awful old thing shall we  
i'm pretty sure it won't suit you
our good doctor and i were looking for it
i found it
look what our inspector found in our closet honey
remember artemis wearing this when he was young around the house  
remember honey  
 i remember mom  this is my brother's coat
your brother's  
this is all we have to remember him
why do you have it  
perhaps artemis will answer that
everyone come to the living room
ethan
what did you come here for  
another cadet is missing
i have formed a team of inspectors to go and search in an hour
leave no stone unturned
god help us i started thinking
gentlemen
i just went to mr stoddard's room
his apartment is empty no ordinary person's clothes are seen anywhere
i believe he ran away
ran away  
in frye's diary
both stoddard and ballinger were friends of leroy frye
fearing that he will be next i think he ran away
that may be but what about artemis and his coat of arms  
if he is involved in this how can we delay his arrest  
he is too good for that all he has to do is refuse
now one last time i'm going to investigate
two of his closest friends are dead
very soon i have to report to the president that we have caught the culprit
have we found the man or not landor  
miss
edgar
 i  professor  
pepe  
last time i was here you mentioned a book and a dragon hunter
yes devil's tales
of henry le clarke
was le clark a priest  
a person burned with a piece of wood
i thought this while i was sleeping
down down down
a warm and fuzzy feeling came over
sick at heart i begged to hurry
lenor
she refrained from answering
the endless night was then seized by its fluidity
hiding everything but her pale blue eyes
darkest night black as hell
anger like a grave
the only thing left out
those deadly blue eyes
did you see  
lenore
wrote down
it shows your unspeakable stress
a conclusion about what is bothering you
that poem
calling us
remember you said you'd do anything for me  
your devil worshiper
 thanks pepe  yes
mr landor
your family
your family cont
a big puzzle
i couldn't find out who was the boss
at least once i have doubted all of you
i never understood
that is not even a living person
sorry  
father henry le clarke
a good demon hunter
until he is hunted down
what are you reading
your daughter she suffers from epilepsy doesn't she  
she is holding back because she is involved with someone else
someone who gives her advice
this one
don't make me question your sanity mr landor
what are you talking about  
le clarke's rare demon tales
communicating with the devil
i don't know anything else in the past mr landor
i have never read a single page of this book
does your daughter talk to the dead  
in recent years sudden disorders have become more and more severe
i am
i can think of every prescription i've tried
he was given three months to live
do you know how it feels when you go to sleep
wondering if your daughter will be up by morning or not  
but one day he came to me
said she met someone
his baby (grandfather's grandfather)
le clarke  
henry le clark is not a demon
he was misunderstood
they swore to me that fry was already dead
they swore that they would never kill anyone
you believed them
i had nothing to do
you are a doctor a man of science
how did you put your soul into such madness  
because
because i i i couldn't save him
my own art failed me
i sacrificed everything for my leah
how can i resist when he finds medicine elsewhere  
dr
communicating with the dead
it's not normal but the murders
destruction of innocent lives
it's a beast
someone needs to be hanged for this
i let him because mysteriously
his condition improved
doctor where is your family  
where are your children
mr po was here before
he left with artemis
why is his coat still here  
doctor where is leah  
doctor where is your family  
it's going to lose its power
wrote down
do
what's up  
there is not much time
i don't feel so good
 i thought  no
just a few more minutes and i'll be free
free  
yes
please leah i am
this has to happen
you understand
sacrifice of life is the highest expression of love
the first moment i met you i knew you were the one
wrote down
 yes    i love you
artemis
enough
 get out  hang you on this
 you have no business here  write finish
mrs marquis would you like to see your children hanged  
 do not ask he is lying  keep doing it
 leah  that's fry's heart isn't it  
 landor  lia keep it up
ballinger he'll do anything for you even kill a man
artemis you killed him
please leave us at a loss this will be over in a little while
 finish writing  leah it's over now
it's you
it was you who took fry out and wrote a note
it's not his idea it's mine
 i did it too  do not artemis
do not
stop
stop
leah
leah
 leah leah  leah
artemis artemis help help him
mom back off
artemis
wrote down leah leah
artemis artemis
 i can't leave him  do not
artemis no artemis
artemis do not
let me go do not
no artemis
artemis do not
leah leah
do not
do not
go
i heard he didn't bleed much enough to get a doctor
in a normal gallon of blood
maybe this is the best thing for him
more than meets the eye landor i admit
i also agree with that
what will happen to mrs marquis now  
a mother is as sad as a person can be
the plaintiff felt that he had suffered
but you might want to know
our good doctor has given his resignation
i am not happy about any of this i say responsibly
landor
you and i could not be more different when it comes to philosophy
but i want to say
if i have to describe this incident
that is my indiscipline i suspect
your talent
i feel sorry for myself
thank you captain
how had i dined and befriended these people for so many years  
i knew this family as well as my family
never felt the depth of their stress
that's right colonel
yes
yes i think shame is on my side
i have to think of mr ballinger who killed artemis
avoid handing him over to the relevant institutions
stoddard escaped before the next victim
you can think so yes
landor
i declare that your contractual duties have been completed to the letter
i therefore release you from the contract
i hope you are not unhappy with that
finally i hope you won't mind accepting my thanks
i think the foxes in washington will retreat soon
i believe we won with great skill
no colonel
you don't seem to be feeling well
i know about your daughter
good
matty what does this have to do with it  
everything
you know very well
it came to me while i was sleeping
note in leroy frye's hand
the note for him was to get him out of the camp
you were careless to leave it with me
this is the note you wrote me
remember  
to a large extent
i was fascinated by the shape of your letters
capital letters you know very well are all like small letters
the letters a r g and e
exactly like the note in leroy frye's hand
you can imagine my surprise
could it be that both these notes were written by the same person  
why does landor have a reason to be involved with leroy frye  
as luck would have it i went to the divine patsy
his daughter mattie
he told me the whole story
on the way back home after the party at the academy
catch him
 lock it up  do not
raped your mate
do not
he was left to die by three nameless thugs
don't make noise
 oh no do not  julius grab his legs
 no no no no  catch it
 legs legs take him down  do not
 hold tight  please
definitely a bad gang
matty
as leroy fry said
matty  
oh my god matty
my god come here
matty
i'm very sorry
 i'm very sorry  it's okay
everything will be fine
everything will be fine
matty he can't help you
please my love let me help you
but he ran away didn't he  
matty  
matty
matty
matty please come here
oh my dear come here please come here
do not
everything will be fine
please matty come back
everything will be fine
do not
i love you
why didn't you tell me  
not one story
said fondly
but i could have comforted you
like i was helped could have been helped
i don't think i can be consoled about that
so what did i do next  
exactly what you do
every hypothesis tested started
what are the chances that there are two parties
plan two things on the same evening about the same cadet  
small
too small
or if we don't know one party about the other party
or let's say one party artemis and leia
they were simply looking for a dead body
then the opportunity just happens
they don't care whose corpse it is as long as it has a heart
killing is something they don't do for that
no but the other party was ready and willing to kill
especially kill this guy
why   why  
could it be revenge landor  
patsy   patsy  
 help  who is with you  
is there anyone
hello  
so the second party was interrupted
but not before fulfilling his need
went to his house near buttermilk falls
to the place where he escaped before anyone saw him
but he was surprised when he called back and told him to come to the camp the very next day
at that time you will know
the body of the deceased has been altered in a dangerous manner
it created a special cover for his crime
hmm
he must have thought that god was on his side
he used himself to solve the crime he committed
as a result artemis and leia went away forever as murderers
ah there is nothing eternal about it
they will be forgotten like others
i will not forget them
especially my leah
she was going to be a wife landor a mother
and i won't forget how you made us look like fools
idiots
but i am your biggest fool
 aren't i    not
you are the person who saw me in the future
i knew it the first time i met you now look here
i am
if you want me to apologize i will
i don't care about your apology
not i want answers
how did you know fry raped matty  
is that yours  
 definitely  ballinger  
hmm
ballinger
i had to take out his heart
they wanted to make it look like satan's work
it is not an easy task for an old man
how did you find out about ballinger's involvement  
frye's diary
did ballinger confess  
 yes under a stress  oh no
who else was with you  
julius stoddard
julius
sorry
both of them
they both remembered her name
i made sure that they also remembered the dress she was wearing
every detail of her dress
only stoddard escaped your justice
i didn't have the energy or the will to go after him
i believed
that he will spend the rest of his life in fear and misery
what they did was very rude and tribal
but you should have gone straight to thayer and confessed
i didn't want a confession from them
i wanted to see them die
what happens now  
what now
it's in your hands
i have two notes
you can be sent to the rake
good
you know edgar i always thought
if my mattie had gone to you
that night on the day of the party
who knows
we could have been family instead
i'm definitely worth it…
between us
bye landor
rest in peace my love

# from tik tik tiksrt
a meteor has crashed into ennore tsunami colony in chennai at around 1130 last night
at least 14 people have died
more than 35 people have been seriously injured and admitted to the hospital
the damaged area was inspected by a team of meteorologists
samples of the meteorite have been sent to the testing center
this meteorite can only be said after that analysis
munnar kerala
the information i am saying cannot go out of this room
you all know that 2 days ago a meteorite hit chennai
according to our calculations
another meteor will hit here in seven days
it will hit the bay of bengal about 50 km from chennai
the size of the asteroid that fell 2 days ago is 8 square feet
this is 60 square kilometers
bigger than chennai
if this hits the bay of bengal
like tamil nadu and andhra pradesh sri lanka is facing a devastating tsunami
many buildings collapse due to earthquakes
because of that even the map of india will change
i suggest we remove everyone and send them to a nearby country
even if we use all our railways highways and air services it will take a month to send 80 million people
it will take at least a week to supply the fuel needed for this operation
not only that if the public gets to know this news
think about the panic that the people are going through
how many lives will be lost because of this  
it will be a big disaster
at least 40 million lives will be lost
do we have to wait until so many people die without evacuating  
we are not here to sit and wait
we will not tolerate any attack on india
this is a map of the asteroid's surface
there is a crater behind the meteor
this is like a hole in the center of the meteorite
this is its weak point
a nuclear explosion in the crater could blow it in two and send it out of the earth
this is the safety margin
we have to detonate the meteor before we pass this safety limit
send it out of the earth
destroying the asteroid after crossing the safety limit is useless
we have six more days before the meteor passes the safe limit
can we launch a rocket within these six days so that the mussels and the people don't get suspicious  
yes chief
we can inform people that this is a satellite maintenance program
rocket launches are common news these days
the explosion calculations are correct
but there is a problem here
we don't have that powerful missile
and not in any other country
all the countries signed a united nations peace treaty last year
according to the agreement making more than 20 kilotons is prohibited
we need a 200 kiloton nuclear missile to destroy this asteroid
sir i request permission to speak off the record  permission is granted
there are nuclear sources needed for war in several countries in the black market
can we consider those options given our situation  
do we need to buy these from the black market like terrorists  
i need some time to think about this
istanbul turkey
please find this intercepted number
this number is actually calling from where it is
i have to close my business and get off the radar
we talked about a business
give me the list
only one item
a 200 kiloton nuclear missile
you know what you are asking for don't you  
i don't know who to talk to
we can finish the whole country with 200 kiloton nukes
it will disappear in any black market
then we don't need you
when the call is cut your network is closed and the clothes are ready
there is one place where you can get it
this country is hiding the 200 kiloton missile
how can we recognize these details as true  
i will send all the details
you will know when you see it
can we get help through the indian embassy  
do not
that would be against the agreement
other countries will ban them if the truth comes out
if we can't talk to them what are our alternatives chief
there is one way
now let me go off the record
this is a covert operation
the report will be sent to home affairs and the prime minister only
we have to steal the missile
stealing weapons from another country can lead to war
not
it is illegal for them to keep weapons
they cannot report it as missing
stealing a missile is not an easy task
because it is not in their country
it is strategically positioned to strike anywhere in the world
in space
under the guise of testing center
but it is a military zone
knowing that future wars will be fought in space they have taken this drastic step
the missile is stored in a vault
can't break into the alarm system
even if one enters the army soldiers block the exit
our team doesn't have that much equipment to break into a vault like that
we can't just rely on the team to get into the vault
we need an expert
we are trying to hire a thief to help us break into the vault
how can we trust an outsider in such a sensitive matter  
a thief can't be
let me ask a question
i order to steal a missile to save 40 million lives
does anyone have an objection  
we will follow your orders without asking any questions
bring me the best thief
tick ​​tick tick
chennai tamil nadu
if you look at what is going on there you will be confronted with problems
according to the 5 cases we have seen
i'm sure i'll be back in a week
there is no thief in this world as expected by our chief
his name is vasu and he is a dangerous man
that is why we have left him alone
great
is he that dangerous   he is a great magician
once he escaped from drugs
the doors were locked the bars were not folded but he was out of the powder
because you all want to meet vasu
save the country
he has feelings to bother the chief
he can't see us in this one side mirror
vasudevan
you have to be careful while working with vasu
he can break any place by habit
you can escape at any time
in the beginning he used his abilities to help a few people and show some magic scenes
later he started to target those who earn illegally
we all know the double murders involving a minister's son
but they tried to catch the son of this old man who worked in their house
the weapon used was hidden in the police evidence room
6 months ago
this has been giving me pain since this morning
they stopped making these before i was born
do you still use these  
change this
we are inside
she hit me sir
which station is it in  
sign here
you can go
why was a policeman from another station allowed to enter  
sir this is it
caught by the system   yes sir
no one can leave the station and sir
do not let anyone close the gates
we should not let him escape
look at it
checking pockets
looking everywhere
all right sir he doesn't have a gun what   so where is it  
here sir
i checked everything on him and we'll keep him here until we find the gun
present the gun to the court sir
shouldn't have played with the police
this is an evidence box against a gang dealing in illegal explosives
if you come inside and burn them you can be jailed without a case under the prevention of terrorism act
for how many years  at least 5
you went to save my son
but now you had to be separated from your people
this is no bigger than knowing your situation and doing nothing
father
his only weakness is himself
his son is ravi
this is the only way to benefit from him
he is vasu's son you can go and see vasu first
let the child go ahead sir
your son came and got you
i'll send him in
to here
we usually meet in the guest area
if you look here look otherwise i will send him
he will expect this i will meet him here
can you please remove these handcuffs  
it's not good to see him with these
they forget their dignity when they come here
this is how he wants to see you or i will send him away
how did you save them  
hey release me
the chief saw what kind of person he was
someone needs to see this i'm messing up on my first day
i beg you to leave me alone
isn't there a law to remove the handcuffs when meeting strangers  
what's more what is this nonsense  
orni sees her son without handcuffs to do it
i'll even give you the keys
he has no sense
behaving like a bully
father
ravi
father
what is that
look in your pocket
it must be hard to stay in this room isn't it father  
who said father is locked in this room  
abracadabra
all the police are my father's friends
then tell them to send you home
i will be home in a few days
look in your pocket dad
play my game with me  yes
father
viewing time is over enough cute stories for now
come on dad
please give me a little more time
father
don't be afraid
he can't follow one rule chief
but he is a good person
i have a warrant for your release
remove all your criminal records under indian army special powers
stay out  yes sir
according to this order if you want to be released you have to do what we say
you need to steal something from a high security vault
i am ready to do anything to be with my son again
if i have my team i can break a vault
ritchie avenue chennai
the third judge's decision
guaranteed no out
let's see
did you see the third referee's decision   mark to the lounge
oh billy
what did you do
anna comes from the army
how did the military know this so quickly  
hey venkat
let me go sir they decided it was not a burnout let me go sir
hi  out and about
they cheated dhoni's out last time that's why i
under the pota act i think they are trying to hang us by the neck first
hey what are you reading  
why did the army catch you too  
i told them to bring you
you
they are going to give us the president's award for our service
what do you think about the fact that they called us  
they released me from jail for stealing something
what is that
what is this to steal  
like the mirror of bigg boss
you have been released under the armed forces special forces act 1958
then the army also needs our help
how did they bring that tablet  i don't know colonel
we looked everywhere for him
asking for 50% of the robbery  
when that army girl told her terms i thought of getting out of jail
a military girl  
 how is he    staying in shape not much style
they are the threat to our security
it doesn't matter if i didn't get my share
but at 7 pm my hands start shaking
will it be possible to ask for some free rum from the army  
hey
what nonsense  
that's for sure  sure
do we trust these clowns boss  
sorry chief but i think we are better than them
let's leave it at that chief
let's give them a test
then let's make a decision
give them a very difficult test
or they will come and destroy this mission
even with such a big mirror i can't see you fully
looks great
i thought he would give them a test but he gave it to us too
we should not lose in front of them
this vault is made of the strongest titanium in the world
your job is to open it
you can use any device for that
but you get to finish it
only 2 minutes
one more minute
take those explosives
what are these weapons for worship  
don't bother them
you have the same terms and conditions
any device can be used
go away and drive them crazy
we could have used more powerful ones
that's why i bought two
do you understand now  
do you understand now why we need him  
chief give them the training they need
passed triplicane
varsharmanpat chinthatripat richet street is our house finished  
they are also worried about our house
it passed villupuram bro
said it's just like a bus road
my uncle is in thanjavur there is no sea there
don't make noise
you said to steal something
don't you tell us what it is  
i am learning about this for the first time now
in space
there is no gravity
there is no air
the lowest sound does not travel and you do not hear it
if you go on a spaceship without wearing this suit your bodies will explode
if this helmet or these gloves come off
or if there is even a small scratch on it
he will die immediately
why does this say that it was made in india  
everything in this operation uses technology made in india
so it's all local  
hollywood has the best space equipment ours don't fly
this is the indian army
trying to be patriotic even now
patriotism
how many of you use phones made in india  
we don't think even cheap phones are here
and you want to lock our lives  
if you really have something to ask ask me
otherwise go
there is a little problem
what do we do if we need to pee when we wear this veil  
he said it's like he's never peed to ask you
in a diaper
you will definitely need this depending on where you are going next
hey he's flying
when the force of gravity is zero you have to control your breathing
if you breathe loudly whatever is in your body will come out
we don't even open a door when we step on whiskey
don't embarrass me like this
i'm afraid of heights
can this fan bear my weight  
hold me
don't be afraid it's okay
aren't you afraid  
what's wrong
that's okay hold on
hold on
go to the left
god i'm sorry
there is no point in eating a lot at lunch
next time we will fly like the phoenix
are you ok
this is very similar to the missile you want to steal
everyone in the team needs to know how to load the missile
the missile will go exactly where we point it
rather than saying north south east west in space
we use x y and z
using these 3 axes we can go anywhere in space
what i am telling you is very important write it down
how attentive you two are
look at him
sorry sir swati is gone
no problem let's implement our plan
there is another way
swati again took a gun
a gun
you're right it's not me
don't you understand yet  
hey that doesn't mean we shouldn't go there
did this come with a gun  
it's a performance
why
is coming let's eat
someone tried to kill me in arehedi
how can someone come after going through so much security  
of course it cannot be someone outside
at first i objected to a criminal like you joining this operation
but now i can only trust your team
we must oppose everyone who opposes this operation
today 5 trained astronauts from isro will take off from sriharikota space station in dhruva 1 spacecraft
sriharikota andhra pradesh
i have never even been on a plane
can you hear me
who is this
how to talk through this channel  
your son ravi is with me
what are you reading  
grandfather
no one outside can hear us on this channel without shouting
your son wants to talk to you
i am very scared father
did you hear that  
who are you and what do you want  
i want that missile
if i give you the missile 40 million lives will be lost
do you want to be a hero after sacrificing your son  
no doubt
my son is important to me
i'll steal it and give it to you
we have 10 hours before the asteroid passes the safe boundary
durva 1 can reach the target space station in 2 hours
hey don't vomit
change into cabin uniform here
after we enter their space station you have your work cut out for you
that's all i'm thinking about captain
what are you doing there sir i look very confused
switch here
from here every problem can be seen in detail
no father in the world would go so far from his son
i feel better using a diaper than this
ok then let me get down to business
that was the last drug bottle
swat vasu lost consciousness
some people wear kalandah because of the decrease in gravity
imagine that there is excessive blood flow to the brain
let's take him to sick bay
press this glucose pack
you put the calendar the blood flow may have increased a bit
it's okay if you got some rest
turn off the headphones
what is vasu doing  
where are you going
good morning guys
where are you going to give  
what are you doing here   i'm trying to cut the red and blue wires
cut the wires
when i do that the plane runs out of liquid hydrogen
then
they are like airplane fuel
we are trying to empty the tank
why do you go and sit  
asking it can be wrong i will do what i said
i tell you why do this  
ravi has been kidnapped
who
i don't know who is behind this but he cannot be an ordinary person
if i don't listen to him he will kill ravi
act as if vasu is unconscious
they will take you to sick bay downstairs
go there and do what i say without asking questions
i have no other choice
swati looks like the fuel level is getting low
the fuel tank is leaking
control devices do not work
chief fuel level is low
the plane is not under our control
it seems that we are just being pushed away
can you hear me pls respond
are you ok captain  
pls respond
chief
we are fine
sorry chief i don't know where we went wrong
that's okay captain
no time to say sorry or thank you
let's think about what to do next
did you think this way  
40 million lives are at stake
there are 4 groups here
the respective group has its own purpose
the army needs to steal the missile and stop the asteroid
the owner of the missile does not want to lose it at any time
the blackmailer does not care what happens to our country he wants the missile
we will be the 4th team
we want to win
chief may is calling druva 1 reporting from the surface of the moon
the outer doors are open to check the fuel tank
this is a historic moment
i am proud to have set foot on the moon
as the first indian
the first indian to set foot on the moon
captain d raghuram
vasu
not
am vasu
whoever it is it is a pride for the country
he pushed me captain
everyone knows neil armstrong
even google forgets the second man who set foot on the moon and the third man
cut the chief fuel wire
it can't be
we don't know how it happened
depending on the amount of fuel available we can only run the engine for one hour
fuel will be available in 6 hours captain
then the asteroid will approach the safe limit
time will cease to exist
i don't understand why he told me to open the fuel tank
if the asteroid passes the safe boundary while we wait
then taking the missile won't help
nothing can be done while seeing
we have to wait here
there is a fuel station where you can fill the tank
hardwa 2 is ready to go with fuel
let's not take any more chances
what happened vasu  
why don't we ask for fuel from a space station here  
are you crazy
ask them  
no captain it can actually work
they think we are coming up the indian river to repair the satellite
this is called dhruva 1 indian spacecraft
we came here to maintain the satellites and ran out of fuel
asking for help to refuel
i am sending our coordinates
i am sending this message
let's see if we get an answer
my goodness
i don't know if god is above us or below us
this internet space centerwe will send you our location codes when we are ready to fuel you
we were allowed to enter their space station
hardwa 1 is ready to fly
liquid hydrogen is very rare
druva 1 is leaving sir
chief durva 1 takes 45 minutes to reach the target space station
i don't know why a small thug from north madras did such a thing
but i definitely know that someone in our department is behind all this
but i don't know who it is
shall we inform our department about this  
now they don't have to worry
keep a close eye on the three of them for now  ok sir
yakub bhai i will get the missile in 2 days
6 buyers are looking at this
but if this gets into the hands of some people a lot of things will be worse
i don't care who buys this and why
the cost for this
loss of life from this
knowing all this i give this to you
whoever accepts what i said
close the deal with them
this boy does not eat
you will not die if you do not eat for two days
applying for landing on 1 hardwa
landing is allowed
the landing is successful
welcome to the china space station i am captain lee wen
here is the boss
i am very much looking forward to show our hospitality to the people of india
thank you captain leeve
we have created gravity here
when you set foot here you are subject to the rules of the republic of china
arrest
we know that a large piece of meteorite is coming towards india
the only way to escape from it
only for the missile on my plane
but i won't let you have it
do you know why  
because that's what we want
after the meteor fell on you
we will get all financial loans and contracts for all constructions in your country
any of you are right
if they try to take my missile away
none of you will leave this plane of mine
alive
let's let the indian plane go after the meteor has crossed the safe boundary
lock them up
a fighting riverman
chan can you catch him please
there is no escape from here
take the deer away from here
did you think you could fight like a thug and escape from here  
don't you need a plan before doing anything  
check that the alarm is working properly
ok boss
get me all the details of the indian plane
don't move
don't forget to bring me chicken rice and chili chicken
why is it so late  
i was afraid that i would end up inside that box
did you finish the job  
yes i put a disease in the main frame system
both of them didn't see that i was missing here
me and your captain tell me before doing anything
your story is just like that of a captain who has lost his place
we are good inside
to open this vault we need captain lee's fingerprints and an eye test
even with that if the missile moves even an inch
the alarm goes off
there is no way we can bypass this alarm system
that is the problem
listen
until these indians go back
no one can sleep
pay attention everyone
what is happening  
you two check into the server room
who is this
what happened to you  
a riverman who likes to catch
a strange person hiding in boxes
the boss missile is gone
it can't be
how  
did this happen
where is the missile    i don't know
i don't know bro
you locked us up didn't you  
how do we go out then  
if you don't tell me where it is i'll kill you
ok then
kill me
vasu hey bro
even if i tell you don't tell
i will say
no vasu
indian plane
if someone moves the missile even a little the alarm goes offhow did you get it   it can't be
i will return the missile
tell him to free us all
he will give you the missile if you free us
no you go
the girl and the others will be here
if you try to do something
kill them
did you think that you just walked here  
that it will be possible to take the missile and leave easily  
we are captain lee of the indian aircraft
take the missile and throw it out
that is the most painful death for him
didn't think flat noses would be like that did you  
get me that guy
bring it alive or not
don't think anyone can enter if you come you will not go back home
i don't understand what it means
this is given a walkie talkie
tell them to write this down
north latitude 898067
and 2215285 latitude
north latitude 898067 east
he targeted our country and installed the missile
uola will not go back to his country if he steps on the indian plane
those who are there are brought back
it has targeted our country
we cannot let our entire country and government perish
are they really scared  
yes they are really scared
i am also a little afraid
if you are careful you will continue to go
there is no limit in the universe
hey don't scare me
did you think you could fight like a thug and escape from here  
don't you need a plan before doing anything  
listen well
escape to our plane before they lose their guest
come on
captain behind you
come quickly and close it
opening the hard drive 1
vasu hasn't come yet captain
we don't have time
depending on the fuel we have we can run the engine for 15 minutes
kamon vasu kamon macho
come soon
his oxygen tank is punctured
hey vasu
yes thank god
father
he did it
a to run the engine
b to run the engine
he needs an adrenaline shot soon
dude
we got the missile
chief will be happy to hear this
you have plenty of time to get me the missile
how can i deliver the missile from here  
hard 2
that's why i had you empty the fuel tank
what about my son  
as soon as you give the missile to durva 2
your son will stay safe with his grandfather in munnar army guest house
hard drive 2 is ready to download
i did what you said
in 10 minutes
your son will be safe in the army guest house
do you know why i used you for this mission  
because of your love for your son
neither you nor i should be responsible for those 40 million deaths
it is a natural occurrence
we couldn't stop it that is all
we get footage of the asteroid's crater
you have 10 minutes to cross the security line
now load the missile swati ok captain
the missile is missing
there are only 8 minutes to cross the security line
ready to launch the missile  
what do you mean captain  
vasu himself has to answer for this
now look at the pictures i am sending
he cuts the fuel line
he cheated our mission by hiding in plain sight
he cheats just to survive
what else can we expect from him  
even though it was his mistake how did the missile leave the plane  
there is only one minute to the safe limit
we came close to stopping it
it passed the safety limit
40 million lives
some of our families are in targeted areas
we will not give details about the operation
will you allow us to speak to them one last time  
vasu released your son
i apologize for being late to say this
the missile is locked and ready for launch
the asteroid did not pass the safety limit we have 2 minutes
in 10 minutes
your son will grow up safely in the military guest house
thank you vasu
if he is talking on this channel
it is not good for anyone to know about our mission until this is over
this is the very model of the missile he has to steal
in space we cannot tell what is false and what is true by weight
load the missile swati ok captain
he died a little more from the shock that he was afraid of
father
look in your pocket
here's a medal for our team
look in your pocket
after all he is my own son

troll ridge romsdalen
ah
hey tini coming up or staying there the same day  
i feel sorry for youthe old man
troll mountain
do you remember the fairy tale about this  
dadwhat is it please
i still don't believe in fairy tales
but that's what you like
and once upon a time in a huge troll wedding ceremony
out of the 13 people who danced madly when the sun rose they became stonesthey turned into mountains
did you know that there is some truth in fairy tales  
they are just mountains
you have to see it to believe it
that's what they say
but on the other side
you have to see them to believe them
can't you see nora  
try it
look
not with your eyes
look with your heart
believing
it is made of sand and stone
a heart covered with snow
more ice cubes
they came in the middle of the darkness
but they died because the light fell
after 20 years
the atlantic coast is in the far west of norway
i understand sir
but i say we are working 24 hours a day
what did the whole group say sir  
i can't hear you like signal here
sir   hello   hello
herethe wind is very strong here
with eyes
has anyone seen our creepy dino hunter  
he started to dig a new place seakerd
 one more    hmm
on that side
yes i am
are you thinking of digging up the whole beach nora  
i don't like that look
called from the university a while back
come on
look at this
it's been about six months since we dug this beach right  
 but nothing found  we need some more time
norapls
we are very close nowi can feel it
excuses are useless and without money
money was slandered
what are you doing
it's something my father taught me
neverever
ever
don't lose faith
you're telling me the order aren't you  
look at this seakerd
we found something
did nora find something  
yes
god look at this  
like a giant's just like in fairy tales
this is not a fairy tale
see
hi
mount dronv
dover railway construction site
do not break the mountain do not break the mountain
through the tunnel to hell
do not break the mountain do not break the mountain
bring explosives
everyone get out
ok let's get to work
 okay okay  let's go guys
everyone run outside
run out now
norwegian armed forces operations headquarters arkansas headquarters oslo
a message came that there was a great earthquake in dover
where is sigrid  
permission is requested to send a plane to view information on mount dover
did i miss something  
orland air force base
raven 4 get ready
raven 4 ready to take off
headquarters this raven 4 approaches dover
how are you general
how  
headquarters do you see this  
 what    we are getting footage of the situation there sir
inform the prime minister
prime minister's house oslo
 good morning  good morning
 prime minister  how is today's information andreas
the defense minister will brief the information during the trip
we only had a raccoon plane sent to the location
here are the photos
godit looks like a meteor crater
crews are on their way to investigate the destruction
has the media heard about this  
the media is controlled
oh is that so  
there is one more thing
went near the plane and took photos
we can't say for sure right now
are these the signs related to this incident  
but we are studying
thanks fred
what exactly is that  
they look like footprints don't they  
i shouldn't have said that it was really ridiculous
that's right
but find someone good
geologists archaeologists a biologist
yes an ologist
 best wishes  thank you
 make a speech make a speech  yes
a story make a speech
ok ok ok i will
they said don't be
this is nonsense
they also called us crazy
 yes but you are crazy  yes just a little
but i think they gained confidence from the evidence they found
something
what is that
tiedaman  
nora teidemann  
i came to take you to oslo immediately
 what    this is a question of our national security
nora teidemann  
yes
i am andreas isaacson advisor to prime minister moberg
you know that i am doing an experiment on a fossil
it's not that big of a deal
 but this is really confidential  a big secret i was told when it arrived
you will get more details soon
yes he said that too
i should have given you a call
you will understand when you see it
this is not a visit for you to see inside
 star trek  sigrid and i have a little friendship
 it's not like that  listen to this
you brought me here in the middle of an experiment that i have been doing for years
besides i haven't eaten anything and i don't feel well
now this seems absurd to me
according to the reports received by ap
you have not answered even one of my questions
hi
this is nora teidemann she is a professor of paleontology
a paleontologist   really  
about dinosaurs  
yes i study fossils
because 65 million years have passed since the dinosaurs became extinct
yeah right i guess we can talk about dinosaurs some other time
keep it up luna
first of all i want to say
it is not possible to say for sure at this time that this is not a military attack or a terrorist act
but it can be seen from the currently received data
this is a natural disaster
in addition to this crater on the mountain
some notes were found in the ground
 couldn't it be a sinkhole    what  
a sinking
water seeps from holes in the mountain
it dissolves the calcium layer under the ground
therefore the ground can sink like this
and because of that gases can come out of the oven
like a friend  
yes that is another reason for global warming
yes i think we'd better ask greta to explain this
maybe with the blast that broke the mountain
sorry
sorry
are they kidding  
 what    are they joking  
i can tell you for sure that this is a serious situation
ok
but
everyone can see the footprints right  
look at them
footprints
are you saying that this is a big giant that was in the head of our paleontologist  
i can't say that i saw some footprints
we found something
some footage was found from a protester's cell phone camera
it is not easy to hack mobile phones these days
just like the one we had in the past
i watched all the videos there
in shortbingo (found)
do not break the mountain do not break the mountain
god
run go run
 can it be from here    yes after many years
 when there's an explosion  sigrade  
take the video back a bit  
stop there
 put it now  don't break the mountain
that sound is just
like an animal
stop
due to the construction work of the new highspeed rail line
drove pass road is temporarily closed
the state authorities have said that the road will be opened soon
 what is that solo shouting    hmm
she seems crazy
enough
god
go inside the basement
hurry up
do you say that it belongs to a giant don't talk nonsense
 did you see the footprints in that image    that's enough
speak in a way that you all understand here
it looks like it has two legs
two more hands
so you're saying he's a giant  
then it must be king kong
the largest giants on earth are only ten to thirteen feet tall
as we know
but this one seems to be more than one hundred and fifty feet tall
it seems unnatural
or mysterious
they are anything else
didn't find it  
we haven't found any more evidence
what are your plans  
do we sit here and warm our seats or do we take some action  
miss please waiting for the words
thank you professor teidemann
help this work in droves
my work can be stopped for now
but i am not going to investigate this mythical gas that professor sinkhole is talking about
nora teidemann
the prime minister has made you a scientific adviser
there has been an incident in the city of lesja
 we need to go there soon  we  
yes i have been assigned to take you there
what is this  
what made you start digging for fossils  
i have loved nature since childhood
i really grew up listening to fairy tales
my father is a professor of mythology and folklore
a folklorist i thought that there are no such people now
and your mother   what is he doing
 i lost him when i was ten years old  what  
i lost him when i was ten years old
at least you two were okay
you and your father
yes
why the trouble  
my father had a bigger imagination than a good heart so
finally he developed a disease in his head
really  
he always said ''you will believe it after you see it''
so after that
his beliefs were a bit farfetched
 is it    yes
i thought i would be a book writer someday
i'm actually writing a book right now
a story about an ascetic who can control things with his head
he is someone who controls the bad guys and fights them
 this is unimaginable  right  
he can also shoot arrows from his fingers
professor teidman  
 nora  captain holm from special operations forces
 andreas isaacs from the prime minister's office  welcomes lesja
this is what we found whatever it is it has come from that side
it has gone across the river to the side of the valley
the footprints have gone two miles to the south
then stopped
 stopped    yes
 didn't find anything else    we checked the whole area
nothing was found
 are you a paleontologist    his major field is archaeology
ah ok
so what do you think a dinosaur will come and roam the mountains of norway  
i would like to see such a thing captain home
chris
you can call me chris
captain chris  
yes
this is what we did not see clearly
it was dark
like it's been rainy  
can't see the sun  
no ma'am
it's a different one
as if everything was covered by the shadow of the mountain
it felt like another mountain had moved
solo was very afraid of that
solo
my innocent boy
you were scared weren't you honey  
do you remember anything  
anything
nothing i'm sorryi'm still in shock about this
it's ok
thank you very much
there is one more thing
a loud noise was heard
it
it's like growling
what are you saying   i have never heard such a scream
lars can't hear much he needs a hearing aid
what
does snoring sound like the sound of wind  
no it's like a melody
a sad melody
the heart is sad
it's like a natural disaster has come through this valley
a natural disaster with two legs
what is that
what  
is that healing  
that is the nature of the environment here
yes ok
but more
something
different from the nature of the environment  
yes different from the nature of the environment
different from the nature of the environment
oh shit
look at the weight
 what are you doing    uv light
examining biological traces
did you see something  
not
only earth and stones
why  
catch it it just reminded me of an old story
what's the plan
what are you thinking
you said to go two miles south from here didn't you  
it stops here
footprints are not beyond there
look at thermal scanners
there is no sign
nothing but mountains
it can't be it's too wide to just hide like this
and there is no place to hide
camlophage  
do you have something in mind  
 god  what  
ah
we have to go meet someone
listeni will go and do the talking
stop it
i'm not going back anywhere
we will not take you anywhere
drop the gun daddy please
tiny  
can you put the gun down  
soon
yes i was a bit busy
who is this person  
andreas isaacson
advisor to prime minister moberg
haha
 is everything okay    hey
 hold on  heyhey
put that down
this is captain chris
topher home
listen chris this is tobias teidemann
his father
right  
nice to meet you
shall we go in and talk  
this is very important
may be
it would be better if you put on pants
it's like you're holding this with a pleasant person
ahno
winter 1943
the nazis used russian prisoners of war
to build the nordland railway but it only made it as far as bordeaux
some believe that construction has stopped
because of something they found inside the mountain
what exactly is that  
something came out of the mountain
that's right because it was hard to prove it they destroyed the witnesses
no father today
something came out of the mountain today too
we followed
the important thing is after the footprints
they are gone at once
don't drag any superstitions or fairy tales into thiswe forgot to send them father
i just thought you could help us with something
we can solve this problem
you know these mountains better than anyone
did you know that until 1840 norway imposed the maximum penalty
for relationships with trolls  
the trolls   (giants)
don't you know what trolls really are  
tobias
they were walking freely thousands of years ago and that is true
i told you not to pull it back
you know that decades are a change in an evolutionary process
if only trolls were really here
scientists find their dna
or troll fossils in sedimentary rocks or their extinction can be explained
we already know the reason why they disappeared
christianization of norway
who knows about this but you  
because i was here to reveal it all
they pushed me aside they always knew
kittleson why did he hide  
is it a mistake   what is the purpose of this  
 a mistake    please
all the works of art he made are in folk tales and myths
 eva's truth was revealed  dad
every recorded fairy tale is written in such a way as to tarnish the reputation of the trolls
make fun of them people did it
they showed them as dumb
evil miserly people are smarter than that
we are enlightened mentally superior
yes if you tell the same falsehood people tend to accept it
 this boy got it  huh  
let's go
i think we need to think about this for a few minutes
 that sounds like a good plan  a few minutes  
we can't waste a second let's go tini
don't talk to me like that
have an adventure young
looking at the head
she has been gone without showing up since then
we're here right  
yes that's the place
ok
that means he walked
from there to here
ඌ  
i think it might be a geiger
what did geiger say  
an invasion
or a female troll
oh
take the chopper down like this
take that down
let's go down now
if this old tideman
an interesting character
he always does stupid things like that
he even lost his job because of that
really sad about that
because of this he was in the hospital for a while
i can see
i thought his madness was gone now
i'll take a look
 okay  that's a good idea
are you looking for something  
is wrong everything is wrong here
what  
all
here the topography does not suit it
all wrong
did you see
why  
after some time
you and i are together again like before
we are not going to be friends again
remember that
i still remember the way your eyes sparkled
after telling you about the secrets of the world
so is your mother
why  
i'm a big boy now okay  
oh shit
what do you think we're looking for here nora  
what you are looking for is just a fantasy
dinosaurs are also a fantasy
 unnatural  no they are natural
 oh my god  they are made of sand and stone
came out from inside that mountain
 why    is this good  
i take a bath once a week
it's not coming from you
here is something different from the environment
more than the environment  
something different from the environment
 dad    huh  
chris
start it
come on
come on
call oslo
i will put it on the screen right now
you must see this
what is that
rena military camp osterdalen
 it's dead isn't it  yes
 i feel scared when i see her  yes she is big
 dad  yes  
it doesn't matter what they ask
it doesn't matter what the people in the army ask
promise you won't say the word troll
right  
a troll   what do you mean troll  
 why didn't you hear    this is not one of the fairy tales
 it's like  troll
he is a troll
sorry
the fact is that we still do not know exactly what kind of animal we are working with
if we had more time
the time we don't have a second to waste
by doing that we cannot make a quick decision
what do you suggest talk to the troll to make peace  
just like in fairy tales  
listen to me clearly
i don't like to see you make mistakes
that tunnel through mount drove
 dad  it is a destruction of nature
 you always did things like that  tobias
go ahead and see what else is going on
 what are you doing    i told the truth
no not like that this is not just our meeting
is your story over  
 this crazy teacher of yours  if you let me talk a little
all we saw was a mountaingrown troll
 get that man out of there  i've been researching trolls for 20 years
i'm crazy too you're crazy too
 i will take care of him
 i'm very sorry  hey
enough
i will go
 let me go let me go  prime minister
if we give some more time we will be able to find an answer
i'm sorry teidemann now the risk is too high
we are running a military operation
you read about your fairy tale theories
there is going to be a war now
this is not the mysterious fantasy animal you think
if you are so sure about it why did you come to me  
i think my work is done now and i will go back to our mining site
nice to see you dad
try to think a little differently from what you have heard and seen
imagine a new world
this is like a troll
this animal
do you think he wants to be here  
we can scare it with weapons
you will be able to knock it down
but take care nora
because of this nature is provoked
what are you going to do just give up  
this boy will not be abandoned
not
this adventure has only just begun
that's my girl
chris

you're civilians teidemann this is a military operation
okay so now let's talk on duty captain home  
we will not disturb you
we are just observing equally

he is a sensei who uses his spiritual abilities to manipulate the physical realm
ok
 ah hai  good morning
hi
some description
ok
we monitor it through a drone
it went to a valley and stopped
more  
we are facing another air strike
how is that  
nora
we have no choice now
i mean
what are we facing  
i can't explain what i saw
i don't know what to believe
let's assume
what to assume  
let's assume
that there is truth in fairy tales
nora
in the last 24 hours you have met with many things
 i think the best thing  i found this
your father
he said kittleson made a mistake when he pulled over
did you see trolls cannot survive sunlight
but look at this troll walking on the streets in broad daylight
then kittleson was right
what do you mean now  
we saw him at noon
but
what other things come from fairy tales  
is this really  
 ok  it's this
when the sunlight is on the side
remind us
we grew up with these andreas
do they not eat after the big night  
does this sound like a fairy tale to you  
the cross the cross  
 these are not vampires  these are not crosses
christians  
that soldier
see its cure is the blood of a christian
 christianization of norway  okay
moisture  rocks
what you are saying is completely nonsense
stupid and crazy
and we don't need your advice
because of blind faith  
because these are fiction  
what's up
is this really it  
old stories have mentioned about trolls who threw stones at churches
because they hated the sound of church bells
this is a joke
what do you mean andreas  
prime minister
looking at all the information we have gathered so far
 we can't say for sure  general  
may i speak sir  
say it captain
this enemy we are facing is someone we have never faced before
even with modern weapons we attack
there was no effect
i believe professor teidemann is right
we now need to think outside the box
prime minister
teidemann's proposal is a radical one
and there is something that both captain homu and i know
we also approve it now
going to another step
good
 start the mission  is this a joke  
if we go to remove people now it will be a complete mess
 people will be upset  but we need a plan
 we can't do this yet  it's over
it moves to the southeast
what is there on that side  
hundredsfossen family park
 thank you  don't go too far okay
victor  
an earthquake
tedeman what's going on with these bells  
will it explode  
ok good
this hocus 1
let's make the first effort to go as close as possible
it works
we need to get closer to hox 1
victor
hocus 3 looking left
warnings and accidents are tearing us apart
hox 4 up up up up
oh shit
did you see   what he did
norway has received some incredible footage so far
here we are in norway and the whole population is scared
people are trying to run away from this huge giant
could this be the norwegian godzilla  
they don't know what kind of animal they are bumping into
it really scared me
a lot of damage has been done
the army is everywhere
we are talking about destruction
 destruction  destruction
a total mess
think about the consequences if this animal goes to more populated areas
looking at these footprints they lead directly to the capital
the norwegian military is trying to find a way to stop this
to what looks like this big animal
we know that it is not what we thought but we are now on the right path
we have seen that bells can have an effect
we have to think about what can happen now
 right now or later  yes
we saw you going towards anguwara
yes time is very important
that's why we need to find something against this
we need to find out why he is coming here
give us a chance to find it
and then what  
thinking after that
what do you think
this is a threat
that's all i want to know
this is a threat that the army needs to stop
 this is not a good time to wait  mr prime minister
more unbelievable things can happen
thanks for your help
professor teidman
tiedman
hi
nora  
no one can do more than this
they are making a mistake
that's all i can say
captain chris
if you need anything from me tell me
anything other than the laughing in those churches
i will tell you where
we are blocking all roads to the northeast
if that doesn't work
well there is another option
no
no   what is that  
we have something
missiles
we haven't officially used it yet
be direct about what you mean
our army can fight for anything
what kind of weapons are we talking about  
why haven't you told me about these yet  
 it is still in the testing stage  we need to think about this
prime minister
does he still want to be here  
really  
why don't you let us talk alone andreas  
accept my resignation then
sorry
nora
i will take him
what are you doing  
to you
you forgot this
come come i will drive
what's going on
they are evicting people from the islands
citizens
almost all of you are already aware of the situation in the dover area
he also knows about the incident in gudbrandsdalen
you can wonder
about such influences
anyway whether we believe it or not these things are true
the state of norway is preparing to face such crises
but we were not ready to face such a threat
an animal that has not been confirmed by science has come out from inside mount dovre
now our history will be rewritten
now we need confirmation about the security of our citizens as well as the country
as soon as this incident was heard from mount dovre yesterday
the government the armed forces and our top scientists
he did his best to control the situation
but i have to say with regret
our efforts so far have unfortunately failed
stop destroying human lives
we will try our best
i request everyone to take this situation seriously
also as we have taken a decision we have declared a state of emergency in the country
soon the people of several cities including oslo will be evacuated
we have faced crises in the past and have taken care of them
they took care of everyone since they got up together
i appeal to you with all my heart take care of each other
god will help us
will take care of this motherland
resigned
i said i will resign
that's what my grandfather used to say
why couldn't i just say i quit like normal people  
i'm crazy
 sinding    yes
i don't know the meaning of this but it is written everywhere
just like sinding it's about another gatekeeper
that record can also be synched
who is that
lord chamberlain of the palace
i know him
we met two or three times in the palace
kingdom palace   meaning      
the palace
home
kings
 why    turn
 turn    home means the royal palace
ok
sorrysorry
i'm from the prime minister's office
royal palace oslo
stop it
don't move
 we didn't come to disturb  raise your hands
 turn around and get back in the car  we are from the prime minister's office
 turning back  we don't have time for this work
this is your final warning
ok we will
back to the car
here you go gentlemen
stay there
cindy
do you remember me isaacson  
adviser to prime minister moberg
i thought someone would come along eventually
and i can tell
this is teideman's daughter
you have father's own eyes
i had great respect for your father
even though i knew tobias was angry with me
he is a really good man
and very stubborn
what you are about to see is something similar to the size of my fingers
we say to habit
women are the first
i won't tell anyone
about building a royal palace on top of another king's house
it was considered lucky
this was discovered in the 1920s when a tunnel was being built
now one more time
12 years ago
12 years ago  
i was very sad about what we did to tobias
but i will do it that way i'm sorry
do you need forgiveness for ruining the life of an innocent man  
i hope this answers your questions
this is the home of the troll kings
my goodness
during the christianization of norway
saint olav removed from the country everything that did not fit the faith
they knew even the trolls knew
nothing matters
more than family
what happened here  
destroyed
it was actually a massacre
but they left a child of the king
they hid him in mount dovre
he locked him in that cave
he left it there
to die
my father was right
he comes looking for his palace
he comes looking for his home
andreas
did you see
the meaning of their coming out of the distance
they died because of the light
it can't be like that we saw him in broad daylight
we saw him during the day
but you didn't see where the sun was shining did you  
how do we do that   we cannot control the sun
what is the biggest car you own  
shoot
queen's favorite this
ok
found a vehicle
now we need some strong people
teidemann
have a plan  
it destroys us
the whole city of oslo
prime minister you decide now
you have my consent
let's kill the deer before it kills us
downtown is very crowded but if we put him outside the city
maybe like ghosts  
it is far away
we need a place closer to that
to akbar
i can say this to our people
but the problem is
where do we find so many people  
i got an idea
code 1 6 0 3
7  6  9  9
3 6 5 6 7 9
code 1 7 8
7 6  8
the code is correct
start the operation soon
climb up everyone
sigmeister give me good news
it broke the barriers in oslo they are going to bomb the city
 what   it can't be done  what's going on  
oslo is going to be bombed
we need more time
i mean the system can't be hacked  
hacking a military computer is unthinkable
and it is not possible to hack the plane carrying this
do something  i will try
no matter how hard it is
it should be like that
do the work
no time to explain so i will tell you the details later
all right
come on
target is on its way to downtown
headquarters this is raven 4 we're in oslo
target orlando airport
this doesn't work
amir
salam walekkum
walekkum salaam brother
 do you have a plan    did you come with someone else  
 anyone    hmm  
if we survive this
i owe you a lot

trying to get into that system by doing something
what if the plan doesn't go well  
what if i become like my father  
what if this is a crazy thing to do    
only a madman can work sanely in such a crazy world
and you are the craziest person in the world nora teidemann

pay attention
everyone come
come on
we are facing a big threat from that side
it will be here in ten minutes
this is what comes here now
a battle you have never faced
if i'm honest with you guys
this operation has a high chance of failure
but we have to ask ourselves
who are we  
who are we if we die without fighting  
who will we become if we let fear control us  
if so who can be proud  
if we drop this one without a fight will it be of any use to us  
the mouth ends here we are succeeding
yes
the bridge is closed
wait skull
the skull fell to the ground
how are you giant  
now is the time
he has no one

i mean think that there is a giant in front of you and step on it
still not done  
no there is something wrong with the system
what do you do  
i just saw that someone did something to my laptop
i opened an unknown email
one called prince in nigeria

there is an abyss under a mountain

# from unsane2018srt
i love that you're wearing blue
i mean you are beautiful in every way
but the first day i saw you i was drawn to blue
so whenever blue is drawn
i remember that day
i remember not knowing what it means to live before
that day you released my thing from the locks
something i didn't even know existed
right after that i realized that nothing in my life
that it will not be like before
at that moment i was completely transformed
you did it
my job is to provide analytical results using available data
i did my job well
no matter how you think about me my results will not change
you have every right to switch to another bank
someone else will analyze the data for you as you wish
but they are not doing a good job good morning
what
nothing
jill what  
nothing
i think he prefers vinegar to honey
a woman
ah
ok then
 hey  hi
wait
 thank you  it's a little thing
so
that report
there is no flaw in that report
as i thought you have looked at everything well
i am happy with that
you seem to be doing a great job here
 i always try  well
ok ok
so the aba conference is in the last week of september
two nights at the hyatt hotel in new orleans
and we have to go
you go
i think i need a little more experience
good i can help with that
 i have to start work again now  good
good good good good good
of my new friends i think jill is the closest
we usually go out after work
 how is your boss    he's great
he has good knowledge and he makes tough decisions
but if he says you did something right
that means well it's a hard thing to get here
i guess that's why you eat lunch so early
hey it's green by the way
but i have to go back now
i feel like telling you everything i couldn't be happier
yes now you are about 450 km away from me
like everyone you know
ummm don't do that
it's a good opportunity i couldn't say no
besides you know what kind of girl i am
anyway i have to go now
i love you bye
ah look at this
shall we talk a little    
hey
yes it's me
let's drink together um
ah
 sawyer valentini  mmmm
a beautiful name
sawyer valentini
 that's a great name  thank you
this name is given to remember my grandfather on my mother's side
he died of eye cancer
ohdamni didn't think so
that little face
is that funny  hey if we can't laugh at cancer what are we  
ah that's bad
victory to satan
 promise me something jesse  i'm mark
ok tonight will pay off as you wish
no problem
but after that you can't call me back or contact me
like we never met
do you like it  
ok jesse likes it
so
this is my home
ok more
this is my room
 oh i can't  what the hell is this  
oh my god
i thought as you said this is what you wanted and you started it
the hell
do not
your life is getting away from you do you know
it is normal to change the phone and create a new email
it is normal to change the lunch time every day
think twice about everything
thinking that it will be understood in a different way
normal
getting noapproach orders is normal
moving to a new city is normal
but seeing someone sneaking up on you everywhere  
well logically speaking this is my nerves
with the creations in my mind leading me to my greatest fear
i know that
but i am not logical
i am alone in a bustling city
and i never felt safe
even for one minute
what am i doing now  
where am i going
or do i forget all this and accept this as my life  
it just doesn't seem like my life
not i don't want to live like that
are you having strange thoughts sawyer  
thoughts are
i don't want to continue living
 like suicide    okay
have you ever thought about taking your own life  
i have thought before
have you thought about how to commit suicide  
do you know the disease index  
it
that is the amount of poisonous medicine in people's blood
indicator to be measured
if it is high it means good for medicine
if it is less it means that the medicine is not good
that's how i think my last few hours should go
medicines have been checked
it's exactly what i thought
yes my father always said why do you trust someone to do a great job
if they can't even do a little work
here are some more sheets for you to fill out
 plain paper  is that all   am i fine now  
we can talk about treatments
after filling this sheet
well i would like to talk to you another day
you listen well
i think i'm the first to say that
do i have to read everything on this  
that's your job as i said before this is important
do you want to read things like privacy and responsibility  
i am done with my work
if the person i spoke to can make an appointment next week
wait a minute miss valentini
someone will come now to talk about these filled sheets

tell diane we're all in the same place
and say that nothing like this will happen again
indeed that's fine

bye
sorry
doskara hawthorne
you see i don't belong here
something has gone wrong here
i can't stay here another day
can't wait another minute
i have a job to do i have a life
ok we also want to give you back your life
really that is our goal
good what can i do for you now  
you have been tested according to these papers
you are a danger to yourself and others
that means you need to look more closely at yourself
doctor look at this
look at this
doctor i have many people around me to help me
i have a family i have friends i have friends at work
there are neighbors
the best thing about me is having people i love around me
have i said it there  
sometimes i get depressed  
definitely it happens to everyone
i am building a new life for myself
i meet new people
i am running
i am thinking of getting a dog
it will help me a lot
rather than being stuck in this
to someone who really wants to drag me
dr
ok but you know
according to this you have beaten one of our employees
he is just like someone i know
ok but he says you hit him
no i was under a lot of stress
didn't the police come to find me  
again it is said that you assaulted another male patient as well
no he
listen i was bored
but look at me now
ok
because of these two violent behaviors
we will keep you here for another seven days
what seven days  
i'll have to look into this
so see you again
ok hello diane how are you  
ok haley i will work from here
first up today is the highland creek rule book
the maximum time of using public telephone is ten minutes
it is forbidden to steal food here and take it to the room
also touching other patients is prohibited
you can keep your hair as you like
you like that don't you  
we hold these meetings to achieve our goals for the day
hmm my goal today is to help everyone
what are you saying what are you saying
hmm
ok excuse me for a while
i think it would be better if i spoke to the group individually now
how are you   what are your goals for the day  
finding someone who believes in me is the only way to get out of here
ah
you seem to be no different from the others here
 you gave them a chance  what are you saying  
not now after right  
ok
they brought about suicide you took the bait
that's what they want
they have beds you have health insurance
but i'm fine i just wanted to talk to someone
ok that's what this highland creek and other highland creeks like it are for
tumbling pine more cedar sand
all these are approved by the ministry of health
you talk they will find a place to admit you to the hospital
then you will be locked up
then athena blue cross medicaid
and more insurance companies pay
as soon as that money stops coming in you'll be fine
 but it's  a business
a business
highland creek is a business like any other company in america
they also have the required number of patients per month
they also need to fill a number of beds per month if they want to run this business
you know the calculations show
most of the patients admitted to highland creek
patients who really need a psychiatrist
and there is a higher percentage
this is like me
 they imprison sane people for profit  okay
i am here for seven days because my insurance company approved it
boom
it's not that bad
i mean inhumane but you should have gone to other places
tumbling pines also puts drug addicts together
hayley is here
few more unqualified workers few good ones
anyway here is better than the others
if you join the right people
you have nothing to fear about ganja powder blue movies
or something that affects your life
i will never get addicted to it
so keep them away from me
finally spend your time
keep your head down
god you talk like we're in jail
that's right
don't do anything attentiongrabbing
don't make any enemies
find some friends live normally
it will be over before you know it
call me if there is any problem
another subplot by nilusha
mmmm
ah
oh
not
can't be
you can't come to me
this can't happen
the boston police have a restraining order against me
i don't think there's any point in following me
because you're going to jail
 go away alison  no
george shaw   is that how they talk to you here  
this man's name is david strine
this guy followed me called me and harassed me
i have come to my place of work and caused trouble and even escaped to my house
take your medicine and get out of here
do not i will not leave here until the police take her
george did you do anything to upset this patient  
stop telling him that meka's name is david
this one has been following me since boston
i've never been to boston
although i like
you are a big liar give me my phone
i keep all her messages
all nonsense
do you remember david  
remember what you said   those who said they would die if they didn't get me
 you are crazy  i think i better go back to the ward
i'm not doing any good here
no one here believes what you say strain
 his name is george  not i know
it is not difficult to get a job here no qualification required no training required
give me my phone i am calling the police to arrest him
your phone facility has been cancelled
do not i want
i don't want to be here with you
i hate you
i'm telling the truth oh god
leave me alone
he is lying a liar
oh god you hurt my hand
damn it do not
come from the other side
doing hell
looks like you haven't heard anything i've said
if you keep doing this you will spend the last few days downstairs
you said you would help me didn't you   so save me from this
good night
ah
yes yes i am sure this story will be the biggest one
yes i have evidence everything is there
eventually this will have to be closed
yes ok
i will talk later
i don't know he's a little weird
sometimes i respond when i speak sometimes not
 okay  you know
hi
 what    give it back hera
you took my last pack of cigarettes where did you put it  
hiding in asthma    i was tied to the bed and in a stupor
oh hell
awesome violet
sawyer as you say
you go downstairs after one more incident
look at this i was sexually abused what do you do about it  
where is my lawyer   who am i saying this to  
and what is the bottom floor  
 what's downstairs    individual rooms
oh god send me there now
the one who follows me you have read what has been written about me haven't you  
you know what i mean he is here
he has also taken a job here
i talked to the second floor about george
not his name is not george
we searched for information about him
yes you're looking for information about george aren't you  
i mean he's not george his name is david strine
i'm trying to say you're not listening to what i'm reading are you   i'm going to say…
i will give you two more medicines
for what
save yourself from bothering others
you too
are you telling the truth  
is that your diagnosis  
are you trying to get me drunk  
when someone comes after me even from another city
you are supposed to take care of me what kind of medicine are you taking  
that's really funny
yes good see you again
hi i am jacob
sawyer
listen i want to apologize to you
if something i said or did upset you
i saw that the doctor gave you too much medicine
i hope it will be good
i wish someone had cut your bones and shoved them down your throat
what   are you trying to touch me  
the thief this is her
this is her i mean this is strain
 no no listen to this  calm down
this one went to my mother's house and stole her letters
i'm not crazy
fuck off
oh
give me that for a while
what  
your phone
i saw it i know you have one
that is a big mistake here
but do you know   i don't care about it as long as i'm allowed to use it
or i tell everyone
ok everyone here believes what you say
would you like to know about it  
if you call the police again
they don't do anything but they take my phone
i will not call the police i promise
ummm
if you want more i will give you other pleasures
five minutes don't get caught
 hello  ah mother this is me
sawyer where were you i have been trying to talk for three days
 yes mother  i thought i could see you in a newspaper
mom i'm in trouble
 how much do you want    no no it's not like that mom
i don't have much time listen carefully
don't worry
i am being held in a prison in a place called highland creek
right here in pennsylvania
they say that i will kill myself but mother i swear there is no such thing
this is pure insurance fraud
when i was in boston there was a man
 there was one man he
that man came after me to trouble me
what are you talking about   are you saying that they came after you  
mom he has also taken a job here she is also in this hospital
is she in the hospital with you now  
 yes _ did you tell the doctors about this  
 did they tell the police about this    mom no one here believes me
sorry mom i
mom they are giving me medicine i am tied to the bed
keep me here for seven more days no one helps me
oh my god sawyer
you know i'll be right back i'll find a way to get you out
but help me
what is the name of the hospital  
um highland creek
it's on highway 90 i don't know the exact address now i have to leave it
i love you
shall we have that pleasure at a later time  
i hope that one day i will be able to pay without asking
let me see my daughter bring him here now
i'm not leaving here and i just scream more
so you better do something
he did not know what he signed
release him now he is going home with me today
ms valentini i understand you
but right now this is the best place for sawyer
how can it be good to be stuck in the same hospital with the person who comes after him  
say it again
i think it would be better if you call the administrative department
highland creek is a good company
decision on sawyer's admissions
it was taken by the best doctor
he has talked to sawyer a lot
won't you release him  
sawyer can go whenever he wants
but after we confirmed that he is no longer bothering anyone
he is not like that
you say so
and you can get money from insurance companies
let's think like this
about the good medical treatment we provide here
i have many letters and emails
received from people who got cured after taking medicine from here
i would like to show them to you too
 i'm talking to the lawyer  you have the right to do so
i will refer you to my team
but
aren't you doing what's best for sawyer  
really
from such frivolous cases
also think about the damage to sawyer's good job
i don't think it's been long since he started that job
then his bosses also don't get a good understanding of him
are we risking your daughter's future now  
will i at least be allowed to see my daughter  
i mean i can look him in the eye and make sure he's fine
is there a time to see patients in this hospital  
give it a try at least once
definitely
you came right when the sick time was over
but i can give you twenty minutes
it is only when something like this happens that my girl asks me for help
i'm sorry mom
 you don't need to apologize  no i have to
i should have told you about this earlier
i should have told you all about strain and why i came here
is he here now   because i can drag him out of here
not he only works at night
guests cannot come at night
i'll take you out
neither this stupid doctor nor the administration lady can stop me
i'm going to the police or the fbi
i bring the most lawyer here
no matter what you're coming home with me
now how are you  
you look tired
i just like to work hard
i'm scared mom
what else can i do  
what clothes are you wearing  
i don't even know if these are washed properly
i'll bring you some of mine
hey listen to me
i will take you out
you are coming back home
and this guy the time of tormenting you is over
sawyer is the only thing i want from you
this
you and me talking
tell me the truth
don't put up walls anymore you don't even speak properly since when
dad yes
yes it's hard to bear but this is different mom
i promise
you are a good child always been like that
but i'm your mother
let me help you
ok how do i contact you within this  
my phone has been cut off
but that nate's phone i called you  
talk to him he will find me
where are you going to be  
i am staying in a small hotel which is about two minutes away from here
i will gather the army
then i will come back here and take you
no need here again
be careful honey
the salvation army is coming
i understand ms valentini
but we have nothing to do until we get information that something is going on there
i'm very sorry
according to pennsylvania law a patient may be held
seven days without a court order
they are not going to wait for court orders
when his insurance ends he is released
is this understood  
what can be done to stop this from happening  
as your lawyer my duty is to bring sawyer back to you
that's the first thing
let me know all about this
if you think there is something legal call me
hello   did you have the phone
ok everyone
turn the other way
 what are you doing here    hello sawyer
thought to work more
nice to see you in the afternoon
violet
colorful stripes
where the hell is this   where did this color line go  
what the hell where are these  
where have these lines gone  
where is  
where did you put them      
where did you put them
where did you put it  
damn
where did these go    
run away as soon as you die
sawyer sawyer
sawyer you calm down
calm down sawyer
calm down calm down
please
from the maintenance section
what the hell
i did not call the maintenance department
we are checking ac in all these rooms ma'am
there has been a small technical error here
in the wires in the other room
so there was even room for fire
therefore it is checked for safety
thank you
this won't take long
there is a little problem with the valentini girl
this morning he was given an overdose of medicine by mistake
a different medicine was given
oh my god
i still can't imagine how it happened
everyone here is overworked
i'm sure we'll have to look more closely at everything now
 he's fine isn't he    it's fine now
but we can't let that happen again
every patient has to check twice before giving the medicine that the doctor prescribes
definitely that's right
if this happens again we may lose our jobs
i won't let you get in trouble
this job is very valuable to me
i know can't even imagine how you work
you work here all day we always need people like you
you are a gift from god
ok i just want to do good for everyone here
hey
so
i think you broke the tv
not
my goodness i didn't think
i love it
 i think i'm crazy  oh no not
you're not crazy
i know people who want to come here and here
the difference between forced people
you belong to the second part
ah
i just feel like i belong in the first episode
what
come on
you didn't think like that yesterday
what happened
who did you want to be when you were young  
 i am    um
shik
i wanted to be an astronaut
yes
but i got to know
that it has to work with number geometry
i am the last of the numbers so
it didn't work
 there is still time  yes there definitely is
have to go to the university of phoenix maybe it can be done
what about you
 too late for my speech  not
i wanted to be a medical student
a disease can be found exactly
no doctor can even see it now
 ah great  um
that's a great story but i didn't get to do it
i mean i had a desire
but there was not enough interest to do it
 ah  i couldn't even pass the preliminary exam
 um  i even had to change my majors
but still i want to do something
so i volunteer in a hospital
 ah great  um
that's where i met david strine
many companies joined hands with the government
but in some provinces only two dozen power plants
it has been stopped without making it yet
they demand something from the government
he is very good think about it
it's quiet it's difficult
and i feel sad
i mean how about two hours a week  
are you talking to your father who doesn't even touch you  
my father passed away when i was 15 years old
 congestion of veins  i am sad
nobody knew about it
so while i'm trying to find a disease that no one can see
who will get his father out of his place  
david had a different dream
he wanted to see us together
sawyer you are always in my heart i love you always david
ok now let's talk about sawyer valentini
in boston from the beginning
first i recommend adding sensors to all doors and windows
switch the back door to an iron frame
replace the door hinges
i would like to explain the rules to you
where are the police near you  
where is your nearest fire department  
these things should always be in your mind
and parking i know you have a different place
go to the back of your house near the other door
i would like to ask you not to use it again
i know it's easy
but i think it's better if you sell your car and go some other way
if you don't want to do that you can park in front of the vehicle
it is better if there is light
then come here by walking in front of people
remember to bring your key with you
keep the keys handy at all times
otherwise you can't reach the door and open the bag to find the key
hmm and i will help you to prepare a small suitcase
you know some money a card some clothes
put things like a torch and charger
you can keep a gun if you like
you can train and get a license for it
always think about changing your route
in normal things like when you go to work when you come back home
how about using social media   do you have them  
hmm there is facebook but my account is private
ok but it's not good because
he can be friends with an old friend of yours
asking them for photos
create a fake account it can come to your account
your friends know the email address that's enough
delete facebook today
then talk to your friends
tell me about this tell them about these other things too say don't post anything about yourself
don't even post it on instagram
you know
about more parties girls getting together
anyway take pictures everywhere
try to stay as far away as possible right  
think of your phone as an enemy
this is your new best friend
now she is here
or this is just my mind
hey come here
 hey  um
in the second part
for life itself
put five come on
 uh hey  hey
are you smiling like that  
sawyer
i'm sorry today is not a good day for you is it  
 sleep well  like dead
another subplot by nilusha
give me your phone
 now  oh my god hey
 shh shh  give it to me now
ok
turn the volume down a bit
 everyone is sound asleep  what  
hi can i be put in angela valentini's room  
ok
mother this is me i also took your phone no work
can you call me soon  
thank you
thank you
hey
man i don't know if he's telling the truth or not
i mean some days he's normal but other days
maybe i was here too much
forget it do some research on what i am saying
not because i like him
no calls yesterday  
no calls no messages
shik
my mother didn't call last night
no phone or hotel room
mothers usually talk back
ok
hey what is this today is your fifth day isn't it  
 hmmm  good think about it
you are very close to going back now
it is a short distance from here
keep your head down for two more days
then you are free
and i promise on that day
your mother was standing by the front door waiting for you
smile
 you are a good man  haha
i seem like a good person
don't tell anyone that right  
how long do you have to stay here  
more
the treatment i have been given is four weeks work
i have completed three weeks now one more week
then i'll be back in a few days after you leave
 let's maybe  no
 do not    do not
 okay  i don't know
i mean the outside is completely different
besides you have your own phone then
you'll just lose my need
you have become my friend
 so i would also like to be your friend  okay
 if you'll let me  okay
after you are freed from here you will have a completely different idea
i will not blame you for that
but don't let that happen
maybe you'll let me use your phone
may be
hidden phones are prohibited
it is forbidden to maintain any relationship with another patient here
what happened to you guys    
what the hell is this  
ah
that's right honey
your boy didn't come here this morning
he doesn't even come for lunch
do you think it's because of you  
do you think it's because of your beauty  
i think it's because of your ugly face
haha
 damn  aww
that's what started it
i'm afraid to be with him now
you know when he's going to pounce he's crazy
i am ok
 i hate you  i love you
your ugly face
damn oh my god
look what he did
you stole a phone didn't you   it is not allowed
 looking at this damn phone  going to bed
see what she has done listen to me
 no wait a minute  catch him
 hell no  hold his legs
what the hell is this  
do not
help
found a dead person
oh god what
nate hoffman
his body was found in an abandoned room downstairs
he took too much medicine
anyway he took too much fentanyl
poor man he was fine
do not tell any patient about this
also if you see someone talking about this stop it immediately
ok
i won't bother you
i won't even touch you
i don't want you to be uncomfortable
i just want to be with you
i have disconnected them
are you trying to kill me  
how can you ask me that  
i love you so much
i mean you should know that by now
i've loved you ever since we met
did you kill nate  
nate nate decided what would happen to him
like i've decided to take care of you
from all the trouble you have
my mother  
what did you do to him  
angela is like family to me
how did you get his ring  
he gave it to me
not
you are lying
you are lying to me about my mother
i told you about him
i told him what kind of person you are
he never
he came all the way from boston for me
so did i
no no
he said he would come back what did you do to him  
we we talked
we shared our feelings
he told me how he and your father met
then i said how i met you
then he said to give this ring to you
oh my god
sawyer  
this ring is important to both of us
just like it was for angela and mike
don't even say his name donkeys
 sawyer  help me
help
the hell
sawyer
look at this
i have a small house in hampshire
it is near white mountain
it is completely away from the city
it has separate solar electricity there is a book
it is very beautiful there
sawyer we can be happy
we both we both be happy
we can never be happy
you can never make me happy
look what happened to us david
look what he has done
we cannot be happy here
neither of us
sawyer i know you
i have seen you work your friends have seen it
you are not happy
you're just living nothing happens in your life
you work hard to fit in
i have seen that too you can't be like that
why can't you
there is no small piece of your life
then you are the missing piece
can't it be  
i hate you that's why
but i love you so much
you don't know what my main thing is
 how do you say that   we were together for months
you were in the room where i talked to your father that is all
because you had nothing to say to him
he didn't even know i was there
but that's your father
even so he could not find two words to say
you keep telling lies that you love me
but you can't love anyone
that's not true
losing his consciousness was the best thing that happened to him
do you think he is proud of you  
as you are now  
 stop  what  
what   too spicy  
isn't this the girl you like  
 you don't know a damn thing about me  i know
so love me when i'm like this
show love like this
love me when i cheat love me when i'm dead love all my shit
this is not you
this is what everyone in this world is trying to do to you
really  
you are a big ugly coward
do you know that
 you are a big fool  sawyer
that beautiful and kind girl in your heart  
it's not me
can i ask you a question david  
who did this to you  
who abandoned you  
did she just leave you   huh  
i admire you david but i can't lose our friendship
did he disappear david  
 did he block your phone    stop it
did he remove you from facebook  
gone from your life
or more confusing  
did he just look sick   hmm    
 did he laugh in your face   did he tell all his friends about this    this is not you
not   i mean david that's me
that's what i did
you loved him you dreamed the hell out of him
he's been following you for the past two years
this is the me you've always dreamed of david
is this the person who lives in a forest house as you dream  
two years
 two years david  shh
 what a crime  you didn't think anything of this
what the hell is this   you should have found another good girl within this time
 do you know   people like you are very sad  i love you
some women like a man who killed children after seeing something good about him
such a person can sometimes see something good in you
because no one else will
no one else david
no one
kill kill if you can
now i see david
now i see how you love me
look at this
our friend nate a book with details
all secret things happen on this floor
looks like he will have to give a bigger book
isn't it good to show this to the people above  
you did a good thing by bringing this to me
good morning
i am
i brought you breakfast
this is your favorite food
a burger with two eggs bacon and cheese biscuits and a large coffee
you eat this every morning
you killed my little hunger by saying that
ok
this is the most important meal of the day
thanks for this
no problem
i don't like people who think like this
many people i know
i don't know what to eat for breakfast
i know everything about you
i know what your favorite book is
that's pale fire
your favorite song is walking after midnight
ok
my dad always played that song at home
i know you want to go to portugal
you went on the best vacation when you were 12 years old
enough now
maybe you know me
you know you can't keep me here forever
people will find out where i am
my mother my job
you can call mother from the house in the forest
do you really want to go back to work  
how are we living david  
are you really rich  
there is a small shop selling food near that house
i think we can repair it
you have thought of everything
i always think about us
how do you tell people here about my disappearance  
i have already changed your stay
the administration knows
just saying that your insurance is over and leave here
there is a back door here
it goes straight to the jungle
we can go now
what if i say no  
if i say let me go  
then let's start from the beginning
let's go for coffee let's find out
i will miss you
i know that
you go back to your old life
it doesn't fit me
i belong only to you
i know it's a big deal
it's not that
not only that
god i don't know how to say this
what    
sawyer you can say whatever you want
you never
have you ever been with someone else  
besides your feelings for me never
have you had sex with someone else  
i'm not judging you i'm just
illusion in the mind and real life are two
i may not be the one you like
you may not be the one you want
you have no one to compare me to
i don't understand that
i want you to know what you've been missing
then decide if you want me anymore
david
i could be your last
but i can't be your first
ah no
please forgive me
if you love me do this
you're just saying all this david
or what do you think is right  
what is in a greeting card or a novel is also thought to be love
that's not love
love is giving something that someone else wants
even if you don't like it even if it is against your opinion
you say you love me
prove it
how do i prove it  
you brought me here
bring someone else like that here
you tell me
be happy with him in front of me
i can't do that
when you think about our future
what you've planned what you've thought about for so long
this can't be a big deal
just just
just a patient  
violet
violet
hmm    
get up get up

david

please help

going taking me out
no no no

hi mom
we sent nate here to investigate these rumors
look at the fact that this hospital admits patients without their consent
i never thought that this would be the last letter he wrote for us
this is very sad everyone should pay attention to this
highland creek hospital is making these allegations
rejecting everything
all you're doing is delaying things sawyer
it is stated that there is no truth in these allegations
for highland creek hospital
we pride ourselves on the care we provide to our patients
trying to say no is a big mistake
that's enough gentlemen
if you have other questions refer later
miss brighthouse
we have a warrant to search this hospital
i am proud of the work done here
people leave highland creek in better health than when they arrived
don't run again
don't lie again
wow
you are very beautiful now
now i think i see your truth
this girl was the first i saw
i have many things to tell you
everything is in my head
but they are stone
but now everything will change
because now there is only you
near me
you will learn to love me
in another year
maybe in two years
maybe we can start a family
what do you say about that  
a little girl with your eyes and your smile
it will be great
you will be a great mother
we will do this work from here
can you give me the key to your drawer  
i can't imagine if we still eat here after your big promotion
i mean you have a big salary now
live by it
jill
i asked you to come here to tell me something important
our company thanks you for your dedicated work
but now is the time to leave
you have to clear your desk now
 you are a very ugly woman  mmmmmm
and you are the one paying for this lunch
you like things like this don't you  
not i just want to be your boss
jesus think about it
it's not just because she's beautiful she's very kind
my father likes him too he is usually not liked by anyone
he works in a bank during the day
but he does volunteer work in a hospital on weekends
that's where i met him
oh i don't know
i just think he's the one
i can picture him even now
about spending the rest of my life with him

meet ernest the real life ghost
the little girl lay down very frightened
as the figure floated over her bed
although the object had no clear face
she realized that its purpose was to harass her
with one sudden movement she came
covering her mouth stopping her screaming
she smelled like rotten peppermint
sh
before she passed out the world revolved around her
when she finally wakes up the object is gone
of course no one believed her
she is a little girl
it's just a dream a further thought
but the little girl knew the truth
the spirit state is real and dangerous
thank you
no one believed me either
my ghost is still with me
he followed me home six years ago
i couldn't scare him
now i tried…
sorry i'm having a chat here
he is very affectionate and gay
i'm fed up

ernst scheller's driving license
this is not him
yes but we can't find a death certificate
ernst scheler is not dead
that person has lived in your house
i did a lot of research to confirm this
 then who is our ernest    hmm
but i bet he knows who he is
 what do you bet    that ernest lives in oklahoma
i'm still looking for where it is
but he has owned this bar
chic this is about a thousand
yes i know what if we take him there  
who
 our ernest    yes
maybe they know each other
maybe we met there if so we will remember
joey he can't leave the house
he he's stuck there
are you sure
ernest i love you
not only you   are you kidding
i already post my originals on my channel
that's three times what you're saying so think again about what you're saying
think about it and talk to me again right   bye
frank will you take a look at the door  
not i mean really nice job on an ernest cartoon

 frank are you looking at the door    what organs does a naked ghost have  
ok i am coming
sorry we don't talk to the media
a little of your time please  
joey researched all this
found the person who lived here the owner of a bar near here
we thought if we could get you to the bar
maybe you remember
ah
joey
come on
you are right sorry
well we thought if we could…
very cold
god i'm sorry it
i love this i i'm a fan
i know i'm trouble
but this is really happening…
sorry
sorry
anyway
we need to get you out
are you sure you can't go out  
have you tried
i mean really tried  
ok
listen ernst
i understand
you've been here a long time
and the world is a very scary place
trust me sometimes it scares me too
but there are no more answers left in this house
if we want to find out who you are
what happened to you  
it's out there
i'm sorry i came here without an invitation
 i could have spoken but  sorry what is the reason for this  
in the nineties i was recruited into the cia
run a program called magic buckle
the magic buckle  
it's like you guys get drunk and watch the harry potter movies
baby
the magic buckle is a dangerous operation
hiding from many people in the government
our field was psychology that could not be proven by science
but our order was to find and capture a ghost
there is nothing to fear here i promise
right  
hey hey hey hey
listen to this listen
you're not alone anymore ernst
i am with you every step of the way
you can do this
as soon as the information is out
millions of taxpayer dollars are being spent on ghost science
we were suddenly shut down
the agency put me in a prominent position
a sacrificial lamb
it's heartbreaking
but now ernest has arrived
ok thanks for stopping by but as you can see we're busy
i would like to see him
it won't happen
i don't think you understand the seriousness of this
these people they are dangerous
i wish you would go
they may seem kind but they are never that way
 i'm back from you  your son kevin
he is very close to it i saw it in the videos he is in danger
ok that's enough going out now
this is a matter of national security i have a right to be here
then bring a warrant
but until then moving out of my house
i will come again
it's a promise
here he is
chic
my goodness here he is this is ernest
here he is
ernest ernest
chic
the fool is gone
come on
this is inside
hey
 hey  sorry
hey
ok anything can't you stay out of sight  
what why didn't he do it before  
i don't know come on let's go now
this is nonsense
i hate to remind you
that little thing called the fourth amendment
they are holding a terrorist
i don't think a ghost is legally a terrorist
they make a mistake
careless people always do
and then what happens
we are ready
the food shop is across the street from the kids
do you know him he has worked on this before
it has had about a dozen owners
can't you take a little time to try it  
honey i'm losing my bar license now you should go
come on this is stupid let's go
hey wait
let me see the picture again
here
my goodness
did you see there is a connection
i found out
wait aren't you that child  
i'm very sorry i don't know who you are talking about
there is a ghost in your house it's you
ok thanks for your time we have to go
you are a genius
the man scheller probably knows who ernst really is
besides you've got me doubting
i never doubted
 now we just have to find out where he is  mother
there is a ghost
awesome honey
ernst
ernst what's wrong  
ernst
ernest
ernest
hi daddy
junebug
shik
mother
come on ernest let's go
ernest
ernest
ernest
ernest come on let's go
i think the warrant is in our hands
ernest not a friendly ghost
a supernatural freak
they think he is a devil
he saw something there as if he remembered something
apparently he is trying to kidnap shirley temple
also why didn't you say he could go out  
it could have been my video
you are not listening to me
he said a name
it's like june
 and so    maybe that's why he's stuck here
something happened to him a bad thing
maybe if we help him remember more he can switch
switch  
we don't want him transferred kevin we want to keep him here
you don't really think about him do you  
i think about us this is our future
this is about fulton's university fund this is about you
don't put this outside of us
this is about you
like always
hey i'm not done talking
you didn't listen to anything he said
hello girl

let's share this

don't try to join me
ah not i i never i i
just kidding
come here take the remote control
protests continue around the world
forcing ernest to show polite consideration
 i like to solve the puzzle  do
 a ghost named ernest  okay
wow
has this really happened  
wow look at this
look it's not too late for you to walk away from this
what
i mean everyone thinks you've been kidnapped
you can act like it and get away with it
wait
are you saying i should leave you  
 why do i do that    because you won't be put in jail  
that's a good reason
are you kidding
i'm already in jail
band evening classes math classes voice training
my dad has programmed every second of my life and it's getting boring
at least your father is looking out for you
it's a cultural thing
we want to be the best
let's prove it together that's nonsense
sometimes it feels like he doesn't even know me
he sees the fake self he created
i don't know i think a lot of parents do that
the children try to fix them but in the end they are worse than before
the sad thing is my dad and i were really best friends when i was little
i miss it
what happened
i don't know it
it's not the same thing it's like a lot of things have accumulated over time
we move houses often
he promises things to his mother which he never fulfills
seeing how much it hurts him
after a while i quit
sometimes i feel that i am not his son
what
you
you are really great
thanks for helping us
i will go to the bathroom
 okay  for a little while
ok
ernst
will you stop that
stop ernest
ernst listen
what are you doing stop it ernest
 what   what is this  ah
what
stop it ernest
 is everything okay    yes
yes yes
everything is fine
go
i'll be here
i will keep watch
if you see anything suspicious sound the horn
stay out of sight okay  
hi
are you ernst scheler  
 i  i know who you are come in
this is my wife ramona
had a heart attack last year
there is not much to do these days
sit down
shall i get you something to drink  
drink pineapple drink  
ramona likes pineapple drinks
anything you want
no no i am fine
ok
funny thing i
i was in a bowling alley a while ago
one day i couldn't find my shirt
i searched everywhere
ramona said i always lose things
even the shirt on my back but
i knew something was wrong
i never saw that shirt again
until i saw your video on tv a few weeks ago
i've seen crazy things in my life but this
i couldn't believe this was true
his name is randy randy mcgovern
the woman next to him is my wife's sister evelyn
a kind kind woman
he died because of what happened when the child was born
did he have a child  
a daughter jun
junebug
randy what happened to him  
ramona and i never wanted children
always wanted to walk and see the world
but life is planned for us
after evelyn died randy broke down i think
started drinking
one day he came to our house with little june
he said he has work to take care of the child
but he never came back
that poor child was left with us he was four then
no one saw him after that
something must have happened to him like an accident
police found his car at a used car dealership
his watch is in a pawn shop
he took my shirt
my driver's license
maybe change the identity it used
what do you think might have happened  
drink yourself to death i guess
killed maybe who knows
it's hard to feel sorry for someone like him
abandoned child without his mother
i can't think of a greater sin
not
no no no it can't be he doesn't do anything like that
tell yourself that he doesn't remember anything does he  
maybe the reason he doesn't remember is because what he did was true
hard to bear
randy   isn't that you  
my goodness
leave me alone leave me alone
ernest get out of here
leave me alone
leave me alone
take the infrared
leave it to him
ernest stop
stop
stop you're bullying him
ernest
raise your hands right now

he was caught
where are you taking him  
ernest
kevin

 yes i am fine  did they hurt you  
 not  are you sure

now you and your family go and live normally

i remember because i took your mother to the hospital
there is a lot of traffic
i thought she would give birth to you in the car
i was scared
i made a promise to myself if we go to the hospital…
that i will be the best father in the world
that's a joke
when you were young
being a parent is easy
they don't see who you really are
they only see good things
only what you show them
but over time when they grow up…
you find it hard to hide the parts you don't like
i guess
i didn't really know who i was
i was always chasing things
new places new jobs
hoping for something to ignite
i can finally be the man you and fulton were meant to be
your mother too
but when ernest came i thought
this is it
i finally
there is a purpose
i finally get value
i lost again
i let you down
i broke my promise
i know you are confused about ernest
but you tried to do the right thing that's all that matters
you are a good 16 year old
than i am at 45
i appreciate you kevin
you have become a good person
look at me please   turn my side
turn the other way
turn the other way
i mean turn around
obey
obey
i mean obey

no no you are not wrong
they tried to smash my head with a brick
how did i get involved in something like this   you ask
wait a minute for that i have to take you back in time for that
have you ever been on vacation  
when trying to drink something in the sun
had a beer or a dozen
trying to make a part of the shangrila our own
a round colony like on top of a pill  
i have done that
i blame the idiots who try to dj with ipods like those here
shall we make a big noise  
this is a joke give me something better and bigger
that's not a good idea boss
the gas pressure is already high it's very scary
do it now remy doesn't want to wait
anything
 it's fine now  given at the best time
who likes loud noise  
jump up   three two one
the dj i mentioned is stupid
a price was set for his head
because he made competitors
i accepted it very happily
yes that's shit
but if you forget
i like in my hands
bleed a good deal
if there's one thing we can all agree on
that's right some idiots just need to die
because of what happened in london you should not go to work too much
so i took my fake passport and fake credit card and came straight to heathrow
get on the first plane you find go somewhere
finally came to malta
that's great for someone looking for old stuff
i have a confession to make
i was bored at first when i found out
the maltese are not from here
also they don't sell them
this is malta
 that's nonsense
but other than that i like this little mediterranean jam
the sun always shines beer is free
because the middle east europe north africa are just a short distance away
i can meet a dubai
back home before the day starts
the task is complete receiving payments  
successful payment of $42000
ah right
i just felt like today was the day
so let's have a look
good ok
wow wow wow god
this is a brand new tv channel this is still good stop
there were still eight episodes to watch on bake off (bake off = tv series)
 hiya  war swan
war swan war swan
god siulin
you are paid to hit me not to break into my house
i mean look at this house it's a mess
before you said the secret word
if i want to stop do you think i can  
read your mind  
you idiot
this is siulin
as soon as you see him he looks like a very innocent and beautiful person
but as you can see he has a serious temper tantrum
and a great desire to get money
in other words he probably is
the best fighter i have ever met
hey get away from me
when i first met him
she is a waitress at a dive bar in town
now he's grown up
these are the main streets of hong kong
and he is a descendant of the great wong feihung
he has trained more martial arts than i have ever eaten
if he gets up on the wrong side of the road in the morning
no one can tell the damage he can do
sorry
how much do they pay you  
want more  
i can't speak cantonese
what are you reading say it in english
thief
you need to talk fallon that is the agreement
i won't stop until you say war swan
i think we agreed not to beat down
do you remember that what did you do
you meant to throw them in the air what else did you do
you broke this kehelmal vase
look at wedding television are you crazy
self defense idiots you should always know how to survive
do not touch me
okay you help clean up here
because i can't do this alone i don't have time
what clean yourself up
i am not your servant i came

tell him you didn't give him money
come on kehelmala you gave didn't you   stupid devil
ok come on
we have to get out of here before the police come
downstairs friend

great mike
you always like beautiful shiny things
you know me i will say one thing
you should have seen this the other day this is a mess
god i really need to get a sponge coffee table
this is not the time
what the hell did you bring someone else  
 stop  ah
i will kill you
war swan war swan
ah
war swan
my goodness
has it been a week already   ah
not but you did poorly last time
i thought to give extra training
thank you but only the coffee table
the destruction that happened this time
ah you're a guest aren't you fred  
what the hell is going on here  
who is this
siulin this is an old friend of mine fred
fred this is siulin
sorry i thought he brought you to make us even
nice to meet you fred
i'm a little confused here
is he a friend or did he try to kill you  
a little bit of both really
siulin helps me destress
after a civilized shift you know what i mean
fallon is a good fighter
he trains with me and i train him
see
i need to talk to fred
so can i say something  
i hope this is the same and we will meet again next time right  
sorry about the face fred
it doesn't matter
nice to meet you
see you later
listen you can be here today
because the police are on the streets
find a little fat fool
keep a fire extinguisher in your pocket
but then you go
it doesn't have to be mike
i'm looking for leila my love
 i can do it with your help  she's a liar right  
he lies with single fools like you who get caught how much did you give him  
about fifty thousand
fifty thousand you stupid thief
he needs it for the visa
for more airline tickets
he flew in from haiti
no news after that
until an old friend of mine saw him at that club
luckily you were there to help me
good luck my silly friend i feel that this is not a very good omen
a premonition is something between chance and wisdom michael
i don't have time for this right  
i'm late for work i need to get my head around it
so give me an assassin
sharing a problem means half the problem is solved
i will be able to help you
meet mr mak elif
an ascetic doing his job
never left the house day or night
but he waters his beautiful flowers
unfailingly once a day at noon
it didn't take long for fred to get to his hightech security system
let's see if this works
a lake of blood in hell
it doesn't get any better than that
did you see the way his head bounced on the ground  
ah my friend that is sublime
good luck happy to be back in the saddle
 hmm  so is there anything else we can do  
 this is  wait a minute fed
i didn't say you could stay
but we are a good team
i've been busy lately
you know there are other people
they want to kill even from this world
i can find
then i can stay mike
how do i think   i mean look at him
i don't believe many people can catch me
but fred is as honest as day
that is an assassin can be honest
 okay you can stay for a while  ok
you can't tell big ray
 not at all  well you know what's going on
if he finds out we will work together again
 he won't be happy will he    not
ok good apparently you have
put that hat back on
because you have to sing to find food
 how about poison ivy    hmm
here we go then
ok
this love and this good brotherhood
the boys are back in town
it's a beautiful thing it's a really good thing
 friends don't give up
christmas is always an eternal holiday
the boys are back in town
always happy hour the bar never closes
friends never give up
i need some sleep don't i  
 it's time to stop
i have no other way
the sun shines more when there is no mistake
you know every cloud has a silver lining
you always have what i know
i can't believe i'm saying this
but for the first time in a long time
if you saw my face you would think i was happy
life is becoming very beautiful
good to be around fred
we're as good as thieves again
we wear marks like they wear fashion
where imagine a beautiful lovely happy poppy experience
oh mike you ruined my fun
i thought i would really give him a job
he knows how to swim well though
you are always in trouble
 a good one  i know you're following me
as business grew fred wanted to launch a new plan
a little more private we found a beautiful place
start a decision making center
in one way
this is torture fred began to say
after several failed experiments what was really needed
because its english translation is equivalent to torture chamber
 this is our lab  i think it's recording
where he tests his new technologies
and i can see
can these really be done in the outside world  
okay fred
ok ok
wow a blow
great friend
 ready    i'm ready
three two one
you go back a little more
 okay are you ready then    okay
three two one okay
ah
uh
ah shik
valleys fred
fred the fire extinguisher is here
fred here's the fire extinguisher
get out of there quitting
wow
i told you to bring the fire extinguisher
did you set the whole building on fire  
her breasts are out
ah yes
yes i think that's all
yes
are you recording fred  
are you ready this is what separates the men from the boys
three two one
why is this not working  
set fire to why doesn't this work  
maybe the bonfire night without trouble
but as an accident
shut up fred
what the hell i go and find the receipt
you can paint it
crazy
one two
three
i said it wouldn't work
if there is no pain nothing will be gained my friend
i don't understand
i made exactly that
this was done to avata fred many things
from the one you made some are good
a lot of them like the one here are a mess
like handmedown clothes be honest fred
do you really think they will work  
that's right
i reduced the exploding cable to a tiny string
put it in the hem of the pants
i put explosives in the cloth
press the button to explode
the other button raised the blast
 so you have to  fred
 the explosive one  it doesn't work right  
this will not do what is needed if this is the maximum it will be a scratch
oh bro
just wait
i think we have a job coming up
really  
what
there is a butcher
reject it now
why  
don't bite the hand that feeds you friend
what hand is it then  
haven't you heard of suzer  
 not  not   you should know better
ridiculously evil
the old way cosa nostra (cosa nostra = mafia)
led by a mad demon
there is a popularity like a hair tree
good temper my friend
that means a combination of cosa nostra and ancient greek
 it doesn't look good  no no but
you pay the price don't you   you see that boy right  
that's mrs susser's bastard child
he is his own person
i will say something someone will take this job
there are stupid testicles bigger than brains
i wonder if anyone picked it up
do you mean reject this  
definitely remove it
the war swan war swan
coffee fred  
great yes
will you give me one  
did it find your postmortem stress  
do you know something
we can get a lot more work
if you don't curl up after all the work
can't you just do it and forget it  
i tried it doesn't work
spit on yours
come on
thank you
a beautiful girl
this is the love of my life siulin
he has disappeared
missing   where
if i knew it
he won't disappear
i had a friend like him he also disappeared
but he met her against her will while working in a sex club
that will never happen to me
a friend of mine thought he saw him in a similar place
i know someone who helps girls like this
 i will ask him  really siulin   that's great
his name is lailo
 and he  he is a big liar
oh my god
let me help fred if i can
thank you siulin
 great  see you later friend
you let him beat you don't you  
no no he is good right   he also has eyes behind him
and he knows eight types of animal kung fu
it's like being in a zoo
you have the right to forgive yourself
 what    to what happened in london
you cry for that regret
you need to forget it
otherwise you will drown in it
i will say something
one thing i regret is being stupid
looking forward to doing business with you again
 if this rubber duck doesn't work  this will
really   make sure it happens because we're leaving in an hour
everything is ready ready to go
good
the musala pahara
 hello  good evening sir
sorry to interrupt i hope you know
in which city did king edgar of england live  
crowned in ad that in 973
what the hell is that  
come on what the hell is going on  
where are we  
you are famous
accident man  
no friend
i think you are confused with someone else
where were you last thursday  
last thursday
yes that's right
watching your mother trying not to swallow
kehelmal stubborn
we have fed you and your cook
speak with respect
cook  
god my friend is that all you can do  
ok
 is this fun for you    yes have fun my friend
because you look like a fat belly
that's right my friend ok
isn't it a monkey my friend   come on
this masculinity has now been shown
we know exactly who you are
ever since a soldier of my party sacrificed his life
just because you want to get out
just wait
you let one of your team die
just because you want to meet me face to face  
i'm happy
i wanted to give it to you both
that bathtub thing is a smart thing to do
you like that huh  
it was fred's idea
very creative
another day at my office
sooser
oh shit mike  
 wrath of the underworld  that's right friend yes
i decide with your friend's shock
you know me well
we know who you are
good for you
what about this little gentleman  
do you know who this is  
at first glance it is a spoiled little animal
unfortunately you are not far from the truth
this is my son dante
he was well made
taught in the best schools
taught the ways of the world
but behind it all he's still reeling
to his sad drugaddicted old man
the one in front of you
 i love you too mom  shut up
so you two haven't seen him before  
not
dante decided
wash away his expensive creations
and the doors i opened to get out
it's all about chasing a noble dream
become a music star
he is a stubborn thing he can achieve
although he has the voice of a trapped animal
mom how do you say that  
shut up or i'll beat you with mukhavadam
every night they threaten me that i will be paralyzed
sniffed the cocaine off a horse's back
after that everyone's ears are polluted
put salt in the wounds of all his ugly preparations
dante smokes more
that porn addiction proved to be questionable last week
dante's team escorted him out of the karaoke hall
once every 12 minutes poison his lungs
with all his other searching accessories
i said smoking will kill you right  
yes you said before it happens
when i lick the cat's mouth
this
not an accident
even if i had paid to look like that
like your specialty
our people searched for it
they tell us that the gas pipe under there has been destroyed
was not me
that worked for us but
 we rejected it  yes we said no
wasn't that last thursday  
we have evidence of where we've been
it's your birthday isn't it friend  
 it's twenty one again  that's right
actually i think we were in your club honestly
you can see it from your security cameras
things happen at the same time right  
what's the name of that club fred  
sparkling clap
sparkling clown that's right
it sounds like an allergy
you know the place where a big sister sings
i think your wife
come on
are you ok friend
you're hurt aren't you  
you're really a nobrainer
that means you are free from this
 i think so yes  currently
i see the ceo of a spineless company in scandinavia
given a contract about my son
we didn't think anyone would be stupid enough to take on the job
because you are a very good contractor
only someone with abilities like you can find out who the killer is
i want you to find out who it is
then i want to kill him
i'll lick a fool's armpit instead
good if you don't we'll kill your friend
what
ok to kill i don't care
don't test my intent mr fallon
please kill i don't even care  ah
this crook has been eating my head for years
do you know helping me
ok friend do
mike why    
armando three o'clock
one
two
 three  ok ok i'll do it for triple the price
you are doing it for his life this is simple
intervene and kill the one who is trying to take my son from me
then you can take your concubine
what the hell does that mean  
ok good luck girl
i would like to lose my loss
even if you run away from here
i can't do that to fred
you know this time was the most awkward
because he wrote so much about me that bad preacher
what the hell am i doing now   need to find something to drink
how did you find me ray  
 listen ray  do you know why my pants wrinkle  
you trust in foreign things like this
they say a traditional english dish
but they serve these kinds of drinks
take this magodia
right  
looks decent
you believe this is perfect virtuous
the taste is hell
but you look a little deeper than the surface
really eating a mouthful
you understand
this is untrustworthy classless bullshit
just like you
but i am very greedy so i eat
i heard you have a small earner here
i don't know what you mean ray
dear ray i hope you are fine
i want to tell you i'm fine
so don't worry me and mike
 what the hell  to be fair to fred
he didn't really say where he was
but that idiot wrote this on a napkin
the one at black bull bar
that's a small thing as far as what we're going to do here
it's not like we're breaking the bank
ps we're breaking the bank
you know who fred is he exaggerates and says
we are not doing anything here
 be a nuisance to you  be a nuisance  
are you smiling
you bothered me not forget it
you lost me
do you think after what you've done someone will hire us  
you don't have to answer because you obviously don't
you left me all screwed up
and think
you had enough stones to start working again
you destroyed what i built for decades
for that
you have to pay
then i'll pay for your drinks right  
you have to pay more
you brought me out of retirement
i actually came here for work
in retrospect it should have been done in malta
so i can find out about my friends
that's a little bonus really
you did that didn't you  
the job of that suzer kid  
you will not be missed ray
yes like i said a little old
i made the same mistakes as i did in london
that idiot should have been shot
old way
look ray you need to lay off this suzer kid right  
they thought i was the one who blew up the gas pipe because you did
because they tried to make it look like an accident
now they're holding fred hostage
if anything happens to that kid they'll kill fred
that's not my problem is it  
he is your friend now not mine
 come on  you two made it clear
i don't even know why you took this job
however if you did it with enthusiasm
you need to know why we gave up
why did everyone drop it  
he's the heir to the susr family for god's sake
this is it the goal is the goal the job is the job
and i'm not afraid of any crime family to be in this nowhere side
 should be afraid  i'm not afraid
once upon a time
we didn't even consider who the target was
 that was before that crazy thing of yours  you want the same thing
thinking of mrs susser
because if you don't drop this he'll cut fred's throat
you didn't hear did you  
 what    the person who entrusted the work increased the price
in large numbers
i'm not the only one doing the work anymore
what are you saying to whom  
everyone needs money
a shower of criminals landed in malta
 you're kidding  called us give details
i don't remember anyone working so arrogantly
but i guess money talks
you have to pay fifty thousand to get the job
everyone is getting ready
entering our bank details into the computer
there is a huge nine million euros there
get the job done right
that's 7675056 pounds sterling in real money
who are we talking about here  
you're not there are you  
ah he was there
yes
i don't want to kill him personally
because oyumi is a goddamn ninja
if he saw your name he wouldn't see it coming
apparently fred is screwed
because although i haven't done it you can confidently say other people do
ray please help me with this
i'm not kidding you
get out of my way
after i pulled this little critter out
let's talk about your debt
we can postpone what we have because…
what is that  
apparently that little bastard
already holding a device to find her location
the person who gave the job will send a link
you get the wheels on your shoes right now
because there is a good game here
you idiot
oh stop the music get him off the stage
what are you doing
theran i came in peace we are all on the same team
but you have to get him out of here
we don't need your help english idiot
yes you really should because this tasteless beer is wearing a device to know where it is
a bunch of assassins are coming here kill all of you
definitely idiots it's on his watch
how else do you think we'll find him  
he had it with him since childhood
look this is now a fuse
remove it now destroy
who do you think you are thief  
you are the hired help
this watch is a classic there is only this
i would like to die before this is taken off
stupid thief
 take the clock and destroy it  what the hell did i just say
 good  who do you think you are  
last chance i mean
ah
problem solved

mr fallon is my son there  
i have very well beaten there

it is none of your business
is this my mother i want to talk to him
mother
i want to protect my son no matter what got it

sincerely mrs susser
your son is a total dick it and i don't match
mom this idiot punched me in the face
you don't need to delay
you have to neutralize the threats and keep him alive
lucky for you i won't kill this idiot
if you want to see your friend don't make that mistake
bring him back to me alive
we have an agreement right  
ok good
then it's okay
 coming here  what are you doing  
take me to mother only he can protect me
listen idiots your mother took me to protect you right  
that's why it's a hell of a thing
you you you kehelmal is an ugly bastard
has anyone told you that  
you look like a ben affleck meltdown (ben affleck = hollywood actor)
i tell mother how i was treated
you will have to pay for it

but most of all he is a kehelmal killer
this is freya's blood
to a great extent
b+

what do we do now thief  
the scene i think it's a fool's errand
why don't we put that on the boy list too  
i take care of things coming here
siulin when you get this message i need a favor
there is a karaoke hall on the street you go and get my bike
this whole place is carved into the side of a cliff
so these walls are as strong as my skull
i think this will give us time to think about what we are doing
with the tracking device you swallowed
i can see
i like what you have done here
you sit here
ok
vomit it pee it defecate it
for anything else that seems to be coming out
are you mad   i can't go to a bucket
 i have rights  you have lost your rights
when you decided to swallow your watch
also if you think i'll let you go away
you should think again
so
i know your mother thinks this is irrelevant apprentice
but will you explain to me why there are five best assassins in the world
waiting to finish you off  
he seems to have angered big people in big places
do you think my mother would let anything happen to me  
he is a brutal warden of thugs and thugs
so imagine what it would be like to grow up with him
it's like growing up with a goddamn spider
do you think it's confusing  
you have no idea right  
imagine that kehelmal destroyer is your adopted father
you don't know who you're talking about
i know no one will ever go against my mother
it will not come twice
my mother is very mean
even the devil sends his soul back
 my mother  my mother shut up
god i wish i hadn't asked
can i have some water
can't
please
i'm not careful with you
you are a magnet for fanatics
am i a magnet   no no no
i am not with a gps signal
like waving a flag from behind it's you
you hope they can't touch me or your friend
 have to say bye
this is going to be a long day right  
i don't particularly want to listen to your stupid ramblings
do you know i hear your digestive system is working
when you sleep three times faster so
maybe if you get some sleep
this is broad daylight
i'm not even tired yet
ok
isn't it great  
this is lovely
terrible
color combination
saint anthony
the miracle worker
ah ok
there is faith in the old days
when walking the streets of saint anthony of padua
he saw a man falling from a tall tower
st anthony ordered to stop
then the man stayed in the sky
his life was saved
that's interesting
the reason i am telling you this
within today
annoying bespectacled little man
if you fall from a great height
i don't know if st anthony will be nearby
do a miracle like that
i don't know what you mean
what he said meant little man we lost dante's signal
this is not good news for you
mike does the work
you don't know as much about him as i do
appreciate your trust in the assistant
i respect that
 but if your person doesn't bring my son  he will
he brings
better pray that he does
this place is not a place where water does not come for these posts
to keep children from falling into the pool
we need to be ahead
it started here
looks like the first guest is coming to our party
thought you said war swan was a chance but you caught me
 what the hell  i thought we said you can't hit down
i told you always be careful there
 i found your bike  ugh

hey hey where are you going

i know what you do
 really    yes
ok
is that okay with you

yes yes they must die
maybe i should join you too
how's that fallon   do you think i can kill someone  
you know something siulin  
with your anger yes
i think you can
but if you go down that road there's no turning back right  
i don't think you want that let's go
why  
are you in trouble
i'm a better fighter than you let me help you
you are not a better fighter than me
but you know   you are a good friend
even if you say bad words to my face
even if it knocks me down
i don't want to see you in trouble
we have to go
look who this is silas bully in san francisco
apparently this brad pitt wants to be an icon
but because a photographer made a fatal mistake and called him fat
silas strangled her to death and never looked back
he is as cruel as a fox and as strong as an anaconda
great it's beautiful
 is this guy your friend    we are not friends yet
 what a good day for that    what is a good day for  
squeeze the necks of the privileged pigs
none of that is here friend
we both know there is one
i let her breath up and down
i will squeeze that pig's neck
do you know friend   i don't understand the use of adjacent words
but why don't you help me  
take your fleshy butt and crappy jeans
escape before you get hit in the head
 i heard you are arrogant  i heard you are a female genitalia
i think both rumors are true
now there is no need for such language
bringing us back to poco poco the killer clown
they say he was born in a whorehouse
very injured like jack in the box
a curved stick held in one hand ready to strike
i thought this guy was an urban myth
but he seems real to me
are the clowns coming now  
 i don't like clowns fallon  uh
it was because of something i said that i knew he was dead
i could have left him the bill instead i killed him
ah this poko comic poko
ddum ddum ddum

ray don't take him what happens to fred  
what will happen to him   extra damage eh
just like the other oasis members you killed it in london
like you have a job
i said coming out of there thief
i don't blame you for being angry with me
 right   i don't blame  angry  
you lost me
everything found in my life
lost because of you
after i kill this little bastard
i don't need anyone because i have millions around me
yes may be
you're just a sad old bastard right  
 yes    get out of my way
or swear to god i'm going to crush your head
not if you do that you do it in london
you still don't do that right  
 don't test me  see
sorry about what happened in london okay  
i'm sorry for that
but you have to take responsibility for it
because you brought me from childhood
you're spoiled
as the immortal poet says
how sharp are the teeth of a snake
such is a child who knows no gratitude
you should be grateful
 without me you are alone  no it's because of you
i became a kehelmal thief right  
because of you i lost friends
people were far away
because you appointed me
be without anyone isn't it  
you're the only reason i'm like this
do you know
after i met fred
i found out how to have a true friend
take care of your own life really
that made me realize you are a load of shit
 what are you    you heard
thinking that you are wrong and bad to be around friends
i listened to you like an idiot
no no no if you haven't you're an idiot
we're killers son that's how it should be that's how it is
that's how it is isn't it   because i know we can't have
something like morality
but even killers need friends ok
people to care for i want a family
you want people talking shit about you
because let me tell you if you don't have it…
you're just being a sadistic expat right  
like you
you're not going to shoot me are you ray  
and you won't let fred die
going from here
my goodness
a good story
how long did you practice  
after you drove me out of london
give me the tracking device before more puppets come after you
on second thought break it right  
it
that was the only gift my mother gave me
i know
that's what we had to do to keep fred alive
what a joke
ok
we took this fool to mother
let's start our little higanna right  
yes
yes
now
we can't send you home
bathed in your own feces
is that possible poor animal  
go clean and change clothes
no no those fred clothes
really  
fallon  
chic siulin  
siulin
are you ok
my head hurts
what happened to that guy  
this is a haunted movie did you do these  
yes
in a way
not bad not bad
what happened to your face
take good care of mom
my mother will be very angry
the way you treated me when he found out
you and your killer friends
i was hit like a soccer ball
i think he will be more angry
you screwed up live to cctv cameras didn't you  
if you like show him darshan
 do you do that    may i  
ok calm down
you don't want to poop again
we were very scared after the signal was lost
your little soldier a big boy went to the toilet too didn't he  
can't you please do something for him  
look at me
because we are here i think
you took care of our problems
hello   hello   can you hear me
 hello mom  hello dante
 okay  mom
tito
if another word comes from you
i will take care of you
i'm sure the million euro name will take my nerves away
so  
thanks to me he is safe at home
now we destroyed his tracking device
those assassins stopped their journey
everyone  
everyone we know yes
what about the others  
i can't be bothered
do i look like a fool for things i don't know yet  
i have to say i'm glad mr fallon
as someone we only trusted to crush a car or two
you did a great job
so you are fine sir
did you know mrs susser  
hearing you say that makes everything worth it
the tickets suit you
but your ego will be the death of you
i will see to it
if i see you again
i've heard that before
there is no debate about that
how are we finicky  
well done mike
a good weekend  
not really friend
shall we take care of that  
what he what let him go  
this kehelmal monkey  
he he he beat me like a dog
he abused me and threatened me with death
he said very confusing things
 about you too  that's enough
sit down
come on
come on fred
what are you looking at thief  
are you ok friend
yes
then the day is over right  
we had an agreement and i respect it
but i want to give respect

then he fell off the bar
hey fred someone has come to see you
it's me lailo
is this really you fred  
 by god a good friend  ah
come here
can't even imagine
so fred finally meets the love of his life
they lived happily ever after
do you think so   there were two sumanas
when he learns that fred is a vicious killer he disappears
he forgot it loku ray decided to leave the changes
with the million earned from suser's work
we have changed in a new way
now the world is our oyster
on to the next part
for someone like me
a good example would be

# from enolaholmes22022websrt
stop from the police
stop that girl
sorry
 i'm so sorry  ah
watch you go
stop
perhaps i should elaborate
my name is enola holmes
you may remember me
after solving my first test
hello
i started a business
a detective agency
opened my first clients were waiting
i was going to join the great victorian association of inspectors
 inspector field  yes
 mackenzie mackintosh  hi
— sir alfred hornblower  hi
another very evil reginald swain
the best thing is that i join the brother
i take his place
a detective with my rights
a credit to the holmes name
best wishes
or as i thought
am i talking to the secretary  
how old are you  
 my god you are young  my age is an advantage
i can go places others can't go do things others can't
i can fight i know jijitsu
but you are a girl
yes i am
what experiences do you have  
 the tewkesbury incident    sherlock holmes did it
 sherlock did it  sherlock
 sherlock holmes right    i'm responsible it's me
that tewkesbury boy a brave one
tell me
 tell me  yes
is your brother busy  
read about it read about it all
sherlock holmes and the brixton corpse case
so my brother
when i don't have a single investigation sherlock is overworked
although his last appearance hurt
an investigation that sherlock can't solve  
the metropolitan police have wanted eudora holmes for questioning
my mother meanwhile is still on the run
he makes sure not to draw attention to him
even if it's not like him
equal rights for women a public meeting
is closed
yes there's more this one
sir reformation is not a task to be achieved
otherwise it is not a bill to be passed
it is something that needs eternal change
lord tewkesbury champion of a different age
a man who goes for a noble cause
until we build jerusalem
but i don't have time for other things
besides he's still a coward
many people have only one goal in their life
adapt to the world around you
this is a mistake
it's your way enola
sometimes you will stumble
sometimes it will fail
but no matter how defeated you feel
if you live true to yourself
the right path will always find you
but my road it seems has reached the end
i am a failure
all i have to do is go home
enola holmes  
yes
i have come to the right place then
is it true that you search for lost people  
enola holmes detective
where did you get this  
this is months old
i got this on the street
who is your missing  
my sister
look at the foot
he disappeared a week ago
everyone says she ran away but sarah doesn't
i don't
he is my only family
from this side
the other girls are still at work
tea  
thank you
can you see her bedroom  
ours you say  
you are in it
we are lucky a lot of five girls in one room
this will help
ah sarah likes to give them cheese
he is gentle
what's he like sarah  
this tall
beautiful
very beautiful
green eyes red hair brown spots
red hair  
we are not really sisters
adopted sisters
sarah took him
who is this bess  
— enola holmes  he is a detective
he is like floating on the wind
this
so bessie what was sarah wearing when she disappeared  
 what is he doing    sh
wasting his time
that other dress the green one
does he like to read  
yes he learned it himself
sarah said she needs to learn about the world to live in it
cosmetics
did she have a boyfriend  
not but there were many willing people
he is not a very good gardener
look what if you don't touch the surrounding area  
don't make noise let him do the work
on march 12th is there anything important that day  
that's enough
we don't need help from people like you
i found him he is with us
bad girls screw up everything
 didn't he write a letter    only this
he worked two jobs you see we cannot live without it
the glass in the clubhouse
in a place called deer antler layer
you keep it
do not it doesn't matter we'll take care of that later
so tell me when was the last time you saw him  
a week ago at the match factory
he had a fight with mr crouch the foreman in his office
 about what    he said sarah stole it
but sarah is not like that
the match factory did he work there  
where we all work we're matchstick girls aren't we  
 then let's start from there  does that mean you accept   do you accept the job  
thank you miss holmes
thank you
finally my first test
actually the second one
second investigation: the search for sarah chapman
i'll find you sarah chapman
red hair green dress cosmetics science books march 12th
whatever you try to do

hilda promwet
the mouth

put the match on top of the comb
push them
put it in this box
very simple
try it yourself
a penny is cut from the salary (penny = an amount of one cent of a pound)
he's still learning mr koch
he needs to learn fast or you'll get ripped off too
are there people who want to cut wages  
do you like  
not i do not think
ok back to work
i want to go to that office
don't even think
don't talk

change the rules of the world
hey fingers crossed
hooray

picking these up
hey picking these up
picking up picking up
ok back to work

hurry girl
red
time consuming
don't look at me like that girl
the register
stop talking
green eyes red hair
then you have stolen something
charles this is not what i expected when we agreed
this is a despicable kidnapping
a crime
 my pockets are empty  do you think mine is full  
you gave me your word that you would find the person who did this to us
you sound like a threat mr leon
this is not what i expected in our agreement
now on top of everything horakamut
 you heard him solve it  come on william
sir do you have any suspicion as to who this criminal is  
if there is such a person i ask you  
but sir perhaps if we think a little this theft is related
 i have an idea  did i ask you for advice  
or did i simply tell you to do the work  
i will inform the concerned persons sir
miss troy
yes sir
our women work hard to achieve maximum productivity and expertise
 isn't that william    that's dad
please you
doris how are you   how is your sister is he still not well  
they are mr lyon
typhus
truly an epidemic in our time
they have been killing these girls for two years
my heart is breaking too
mr mcintyre i wonder if we'll have something for lunch   we need both
how did sarah do it   went into the office  
there was a fire at one place went to see about it
whose place
is this house  
yes
you are a good investigator enola holmes
everyone thinks that conducting inspections is a legal job
but the truth is there is only one law
pull from every corner you can find
he is a corner
so i pull from there
 ah  hello sir
 good evening  young girl i am married
hello dear forgot the ticket  
that's too good for a cheater like you
a piece is a penny
 the best toffee  get out of the way girl
a piece is a penny
where are you
sorry sir
i have never seen anything like this
here he comes
one two one two three four
where is that hat from   where did you get that tie  
it's welldressed good style isn't it  
i want to get one like that too
everywhere i go they ask hello where's that hat from  
everywhere i go they ask hello where's that hat from  
where is that hat from   where did you get that tie  
it's welldressed good style isn't it  
i want to get one like that too
everywhere i go they ask hello where's that hat from  
now from shanghai
the wonderful world with mr lee
my next magic
are you the one who took my stick  
not i am looking for a girl
ah
hmm
he worked two jobs
in a place called deer horn
everywhere i go they ask hello where's that hat from  
you have five seconds to explain why you came here
did sarah work here  
that's right isn't it   bessie doesn't know about this
there's a lot bessie doesn't know there are many things you should not say to him
i know you helped him he took the pages why  
 what happened to him    let us be at a loss right  
mixed girls like you are irrelevant to this fight
sankara or not i can do well sutton
now tell me where is he hiding and what does he know  
you have more than i thought
whatever it is you have to get on this stage now
he is still not dressed properly
let him go now
 remove from here  i will gladly do it
come on
where does sarah chapman do her makeup  
he has many secrets not a bad character
i'd kick him if he wasn't so good
but he attracted people with big pockets
it is always useful
what people
there was a gentleman a member of society who came here often
always looked for the girl sent flowers and letters
his name
never given
you see everyone thinks there is hope love is coming their way
but it never comes
the guy likes it he wants the cheap
but they marry big people
because we both ate the fruit of love
the fruit of love   ah
a bell rang in the sky above
so that place is full of white puss
a church stands far away and waits
a poppy flower
is this his name  
why did he go  
purpose  
who is this guy
did she run off with this guy  
lover  
a new life  
or run away from him  
is it dangerous  
i think this letter is important his poems are the last
the boy is away
ok
 sherlock    enola
what are you doing here not careful here
there are dangerous people here
yes tell me if you meet someone
 brother are you here    i'm fine
just a disagreement over a wine glass
and who owns the wine glass  
so
i found it hard to move my arms and legs after wine
let's take you home
i don't usually drink but i'm on a test
 it proved difficult  taxi
 hello  hello
 where are we going   — 221 baker street
baker street
apparently my brother is seriously overweight
it's like picking up a dead horse from the back of another dead horse
this is a i'm in b
i didn't know about the stairs
there should definitely be stairs to stop people stepping on them
that's a help you better write it down
ok raise the right leg
hmmm
now your left
good leg left you write that down too
and at home well done sherlock
i can do it
did you see
baker street
 but this is a mess  this is great do not touch anything
what is your test about  
financial crimes
it doesn't matter to you i work alone this is personal
now sh sh i'm thinking
never interrupt someone who is thinking
 you now  write it down  
sh sh
don't go there
not
sherlock's newest investigation
great
who are you
why why did you do everything here and there  
 i don't see any difference  no difference   low
is your head hurt   i can't think why
this is why i don't bring people into the room
look what you did all my leaves are messy
your test oppresses you
it seems that there are many question marks in your map
stupid cake the door
 i'll see you again  is that why you drink  
i am very sure this is not very old
 maybe i can help  you can go here and help
haha yes the world will be very safe
unless we look inside sherlock holmes
crazy idea
have you thought about a housemate  
 for what reason    stop falling into this situation
strange
people who come looking for advice are always abandoned
did i ask you for advice   i found you on the street drunk
 now what do i want to see from you    we are not playing here
the shoe is superior the hair is not so good
 you and mycroft look alike  you have to wash clothes
 i don't like to see the past  you are pale
 stop  here are your fingernails
 why did you work in a match factory    what  
last night the nails were dirty and green this morning they are black
this is what happens when phosphorus is mixed with oxygen to make matches
i wasn't in such a state of confusion that i didn't see it
 how are you  your neck is red
if someone has squeezed or put a knife
are you involved in something dangerous  
you are still in my custody
if you need my help i am ready anytime
don't be so harsh prove yourself enola
i'm not cruel and i don't need anyone's help
but i'll take this
how is he how can he lecture me  
when he couldn't even solve his own test
and he lives in a pile of leaves that disturbs his mind
how can he say i'm terrible   that's not true
 and this is unfair  enola
this is you
ah it's you
how are you  
are you ok your look
i'm doing a test in disguise forget that i gave that information
that's strange i could swear i've seen you here before
is that so  
this is my my way to lord's
is it   died
i i sometimes have breakfast here
i mean yes this is a beautiful place i know the gardener here
we talk about what to grow next season
sunflower looks good
sweet william flowers because of their strange red color
i see what you're doing
it's it's nothing
in newspaper pages
men of the city 1 viscount tewkesbury 2 duke of clarence
you are a very eligible bachelor
don't believe what you read
i wrote to you
you didn't answer
ah
i've been busy
started my own business a constant challenge
maybe you don't understand
 enola if you need help  i don't
if my question is gardening related i will call you
ok
so you know where i stand
if a plant disappears
enjoy your breakfast then
ok
does he look back  
good not looking
i don't come here every day
only on days when i felt like it
maybe he doesn't come this way he goes on the other parallel road
you know where i am
you know where i am
out of sight
the church stands afar off and waits
the white church
because we both ate the fruit of love
because we both ate
two ate twoeight (how it sounds in english)
twenty eight
a bell rang in the sky above
a bell  
what is that place
the bell the place out of sight
28 bell place whitechapel
sh
sorry
the game started again
i'm not lying
there is a certain satisfaction in being a detective
when you can get to an answer
like sewing a new skirt
something i don't do or like teaching a dog to sit
you get to shine with the recognition of a job well done
there's a new holmes in town
that's right sherlock holmes has got a competitor
sherlock has found his equal
enola holmes: the great detective is born
my name will be known bessie will have her sister again
that's how it works
arts
sarah  
what happened here  
mr poppy
ah this
what happened who did this  
is she   sarah's boyfriend   this
no no no everything is fine
i will get you a doctor
do not no no no
do not
come back
miss holmes  
inspector lestrade
— enola holmes  lestrade
 this one this one  dead
how did that happen  
no no no i'm on a test about a missing girl
 is this that girl    no no no his name is this
he worked at the paragon theatre and at the match factory
he is a dramatist his friend
superintendent greil
 good morning  good morning sir
i was sent to investigate a riot
i heard someone yelling at someone and then i met this young lady
his name  
enola holmes
his sister
this is also a tester
my goodness another one
you have to finish school don't you  
a disappearance is being investigated
 sarah chapman  yes
sarah chapman   how charming i'm looking too
 he is wanted for theft and threats    a threat  
yes inspector
still hot the body has not been embalmed
 what time did you hear the shouting inspector    in ten minutes of this hour sir
what time did you come inspector  
almost at the same time
more charming
not not i tried to stop the bleeding i tried to save him
or get information from him
check him out inspector
i can't i can't touch him sir
come on lestrade let us not be ashamed of this
 he is an inspector he knows the rules  yes
hmm
give me that bag
what is this  
my evidence
that one  
it's nothing
so why hide it  
found near a freshly dead body
therefore hiding the evidence will not be a good thing
superintendent greil you can't believe
what can't i believe miss  
that young women are not strong enough to kill  
now give them here
ah
 go  after him everyone
why did he do that  
get out of the way
stop that girl
you've seen this before
ah lestrade from scotland yard i hope you remember me
we are looking for your sister he caused some trouble
will you come
is this sir  
is this
take it i have more
get it i can't
i can
i can't
maybe i can
and this the famous veena  
i don't care about that
maybe you can tell me what you think enola did
if i could say so sir
no problem
ah your latest test
what is this about  
is this another brixton bottleneck  
or in periwinkle  
don't tell me it's in clackenwell
what is the evidence against my sister  
maybe if you tell me about yours i'll tell you about mine
a government case a disappearance of money
now you
the higher ups want to talk to him
 why    i follow orders mr holmes
or should i call you sherlock  
graydon graydon lestrade
my father thought it was glorious
anyway you should tell me that sometime
ok
the way you say it
my goodness
wow
my mistake i could have said that this is open
not
may i ask
good evening
should i ask for help  
don't think tell me everything
 a government investigation    not
is this another brixton bottleneck  
or or in periwinkles  
tell me yours and i'll tell you mine
he is a rhetorician i wanted to know about you
money unaccounted money transfers happen in government offices
my theory is either revenge kidnapping or threats
what did you find
separate files in five different accounts
going through the treasury to a private bank
 is anyone getting rich from this    yes
 who    no name
just a number
i went to the bank and checked money is missing
go to another bank and from there to another bank
another one another one another one another one
each of them is hidden by a different bank number
twenty seven in all
 what can you guess from that    three things
first he is a playboy perhaps a brilliant mathematician
someone who can hide all his work
second the sources have changed
five banks on the right side of the river but there is no obvious connection with them
all are anonymous
all in one pocket
the third one  
he knows i'm after him
what how  
every time i pull a string it unravels disappears
appears elsewhere like he's asking me to a dance
it
it is infuriating
so no evidence  
one a week before the first exchange
there was a sneak into the treasurer's office
a man wearing a lowcrowned hat
a lowcrowned hat
 what have you taken    a file
they don't talk about it must be confidential information
but i still can't imagine how it relates to this
your turn i don't think the blood is yours
i'm looking for a girl sarah chapman
his sister hired me bessie
he worked at leon's match factory during the day and at the music hall at night
he has a lover
i went to his house
he gave this to the girl
28 bell place  
whitechapel oo
there i met her friend
killed
who killed him   is poppy the guy  
pilot on the language of flowers
poppy
the death
i suspect so
maybe he kidnapped sara and his friend found out
love
what does it do to people  
 how did he die    with a kitchen knife
 did you touch this weapon    not
then why did you run  
i found more evidence from him
this cop wanted it
 he walks like this  grail
we have a past
this was in his pocket
this is as bad as poetry
 put this with me  no
this is mine and this is important
grail said she was stealing something and threatening them
 but sarah doesn't do that  you don't know this person
i feel so
you came here to escape from the police
someone is already dead
you are now a suspect in a murder case
you put your emotions ahead of your talent
stay here do not go i will look into this
but sarah chapman is my responsibility no one else cares about these guys
i promised her sister
the first mistake a detective makes
making an event personal
enola i know you don't like advice
but please
do not oppose me
i better write it down
matches matches come and get matches
a box is a penny
matches matches a box is a penny
come and get the matches
this fight is irrelevant to sankara girls like you
we don't need help from people like you
see everyone thinks there is hope love will come to them
but that won't happen
men are like that they look for cheap
but they marry the rich
and poppy you're a gentleman aren't you  
and a rich person buys such a love nest
 sir  don't joke
viscount tewkesbury
there was a sneaking into the treasury office
a man wearing a lowcrowned hat
now the white leon matches to a bright flame
five banks on the right side of the river but there is no obvious connection with them
the matchmaker's ballroom dance
held by henry and hilda lyon 12 marchmont square
is this day important to you  
this is not really a day
his eldest son william lyon led the first
sweet williams flowers because of their strange red color
every woman works at her maximum productivity and efficiency
 isn't that so william    that's dad
until now i thought you were a poppy
let's see how good you are sweet william
i'm going to the ballroom dance
ah
rules of etiquette
attending a ballroom dance
1 your dress
2 your mask
3 polite conversation
this is me
this is not me
this is very important when looking for the police
be quiet for his highness viscount macintyre
i apologize for interrupting this wonderful occasion
but i am a politician
any chance to be on stage i will definitely take it
i would definitely like to thank our host
applauding his victory
no masks no problem
for henry lyon gilding all before him
nonsense to pewter metal at most
what he has done to matches is legendary
in two years he turned red to black
or should i say
red to white  
get the attention of this mysterious man
to the feverish and the working poor
raise funds recognize ills in society
i can't imagine simply overflowing
ladies and gentlemen welcome henry lyon
and his best son heir william
for the future
 for the future  may you shine forever
ok henry ignite
with pleasure
now go and have fun
i'm sure i've seen this dress before
yes last year
i think this is beautiful and wonderful
i hope you are kind
gentlemen
ma'am
good evening
this is a beautiful opportunity isn't it  
i mean weird fun
the orchestra is very tuned
i thought
if i may speak to you mr lyon
 did i say something wrong    where is your guardian  
the guardian  
my dear you cannot imagine that my son will talk to you alone
37 presence of guardian
ah
38 absence of guardian
dying alone without a guardian
can't i talk to you without a guardian  
no time
honestly  
honestly  
who is this woman  
they are talking
they are dancing
good evening dear
ok
how stupid of me
good evening
i can say quite justifiably
i prepared very well
but dancing is not my ability
but
kneel up mother brown you need to go under the table
yesterday yesterday yo
you saw my situation
who are you
this guy is playful
files in five different accounts
a person who can hide all work a private bank
disappears reappears no name just a number
maybe become a math champion
trying to make me dance
this is a puzzle
a polka dance
dancing around two feet
all these are dances
dance dance dance
at twenty seven
yes the language of dance
twentyseven dances
i caught you
first dance then 14 22
finally isn't it   these things
everyone is a stranger an archetype
have we met before  
i feel familiar somewhere
i have a normal face
mira troy
private secretary to lord macintyre
treasury minister
tabitha
tabitha timothy
don't let them think about you
this is just an act
everyone is doing their part here
testing others
win
lose
it's fun
when you know the rules
what are those people doing with their eyes  
sending messages
saying everything forbidden
or say embarrassing things out loud
thank you very much for the lesson
a lesson learned the hard way
without power we women must believe in our cuteness our own luck
because our opportunities are very limited here
take my advice
i don't care about this
if you want to talk to william
you should try this
no no not you ah
help
i was very excited
actually it doesn't have to be that harsh
i didn't think
tewkesbury
 can't imagine your time  enola  
don't talk to me here unless you want to be dragged out into the street
 i want to learn dancing from you  teach to dance   when  
 teach me to dance now  ah
do you understand that i have been learning dance since i was five years old  
great i was afraid that you are not a good teacher
 what are you doing here    i'm looking for an assassin
that's something i shouldn't tell you forget what i said
 i am trying to save a girl's life  a dance  
oh tewkesbury
ok keep your back straight
i have my hand here here
ah right
put your hand out
good
now watch and do what i do
 it seems like a mistake  face over my shoulder
now one two three
two three two three
four two three one two three
two three
good
you seem different than the last time we spoke
tell me why you come to the park
why why am i walking into lord's  
simply keep an eye on you
if you suddenly find yourself in a difficult situation
 like being thrown out of a train  enola
can't believe you're being careful
i am now a man
you become a man when i say so
also the times i get into trouble are not inside the body
now come on
two three two three
look into my eyes
rhythm is always there
a dance is a belief it is a combination
that's why i like this
although my uncle taught me to dance
that guy looks like a pork pie
his breath
turn around two
turn did you feel
i can feel it
good
 you dance well  maybe i got a good teacher
although his breath is better than i thought
we have an urgent need
i have to go
you need a dance card
but i don't really know
 what does that mean    you will learn
don't touch the ginger cake they play with the intestines
ah
hello
 mr leon  yes
i was wondering if we could get together for a dance this evening
my dance card is full
can i see it
there's your last waltz
how good
if you don't mind
until then
this is him
you like lord tewkesbury don't you  
not
not
we are old friends
i heard that he is a good person a good reformer
hmm
if you want to dance with him you have to be patient
there is a long queue
yes i don't want to miss the opportunity
good evening miss  
tabitha
sicily
sorry to interrupt my name is cecily
your friend tabitha said we should dance
is it  
ladies and gentlemen please come to the last waltz
you know i swear i know your face
why is that happening  
we haven't met before
but i saw you looking why  
definitely paragon music hall
i saw you talking to a young lady there
sarah chapman
if you leave me i will scream
the police are after you mr leon at this point we both followed
you are not invited here what do you want
i am a private investigator sarah's sister was hired to find him
bessie hired you  
do you know bessie  
let me stay please
otherwise you will destroy everything
 how   what destroys    they are waiting
if you are so stubborn about it meet at the library at midnight
don't say anything else now
midnight then
moriarty
who are you
 you come to the wrong places  why are you holding a thorn  
you go now i'm waiting for someone else
need a weapon to meet someone you fear  
you always come when i don't want you
sometimes even when necessary
 what's wrong with you    nothing about you
i like the person you danced with what's the name cecily  
she will be a good wife for you
enola i only think of you
tewksbury if you stay here he'll be scared away
scare him   all this for a man  
please go
lord tewkesbury
enola holmes you are under arrest
if you try to escape this will be even more difficult
if we do this less loudly there will be less shame from good people
 sir whatever this is i'm sure  murder sir
this is about murder
tewksbury no problem
constable go
take care of these
 please  come here
come on
 ah i mean  i learned that he is not relevant here
 a lot of garbage  a shame
a good party
i heard you danced with young mr leon
may i ask respectfully i'm sure
did you want to kiss him  
or wanted to find out more about your test  
is this about sarah chapman  
look if you want to take care of him
know this
i will take good care of him
someone wants to talk to him
they are not as kind as me
someone  
who
why did you follow me that night  
you went after this house didn't you  
that's how you found home
nice shirt
silk  
on a policeman's salary  
who pays you superintendent greil  
who pays you to kill matchmaking girls  
where is sarah chapman  
 i don't know  she is a thief and a troublemaker
you don't have to sacrifice your life for him
if i can get it from you i'll get it from someone else
like her sister little bessie
she is a little girl
that's how everyone starts enola holmes
little girls like her and you and sarah chapman
asking questions suspecting higher officials
not concerned about their safety
they are trying to break it
a small flame is all it takes to start a fire
my job is to remove those kind of kehelmal flames
now i'll be kind
you are given one more chance
where is he
i don't know
then you will be thrown into the dungeon
an investigator like you
you had to sew
sir  
 sir  a joke
superintendent greil
mr holmes
i came for my sister
if you can set her free
it is much appreciated
i am her guardian and she is a child
and a murderer
the evidence you think you have against him
i have a lot
people saw him arguing with the victim following him
fighting finally standing in front of his dead body
when we found him he had blood on his hands
she is bleeding
i saw your scene
the marks on the door and around it showed that it had been broken open
that too soon
there were signs of a struggle
and shoe marks of three entrants
one of them is heavy
that is depending on the height and extent of the damage
marks and blood stains on fabric
we are told that there was one more very much a woman
he has fought back
using a sharp weapon
before jumping out the window
this is a planned search and interrogation
knowing about it these two women
then my sister came
you came to her incredibly quickly
now will you release him or shall i  
 sergeant beeston can you  sir
comparison of fingerprints
a new discovery in switzerland
 have you heard about it    yes
are you looking into this  
this made our work much faster
especially in murders
my sister did not touch this weapon
so why are his marks on this  
we live in good times don't we mr holmes  
do you realize what time it is  
 hello edith  you're lucky break the legs a little more
then i realized the shoulder
 you have a recognizable shoulder  enola is arrested

what he's up to
it can spread more than i thought
there is something about this test
you can't solve it by yourself right  
i need your
i need your help
we need your help
five minutes of exercise
as my mother always says
people who can be someone else when they need to be
the truly brave among us
your mother is very different from mine
i tried to stop him
but he wants to fight
here we go finally
you can't control enola holmes
he is a force of nature
a law of his own
look after him girl

don't worry this is absolutely no oppression
 your left side  mine or yours

i heard he is doing a good job
 that's right  uhhuh
so he might be useful
i don't call him my boy
you know sometimes i wonder if i've made you all alone too much
 mother  i did it for all of you
your goal should be to find out who you are
you sherlock mycroft
strong serious independent children
but maybe with a little loneliness
you're doing very well on your own enola
but with others you can be great
who do you think prepared all this  
am i
not you need to find friends
work with them and you will be the most you
you speak with one voice
but you can make incredible sounds
come on he has to go let's get rid of him
you're down
look ahead
if you get caught in a murder again yell at me
i will do
thank you edith
be careful
cut the hair
it's a mess
i think my hair is fine

i want to pack your things
i want you to be careful
my is my sister gone

i'm sure he's fine
i'm about to find him
doris
he will take me in
he now has an extra bed
his sister  
dead
the plague
dead
there is something in this soil
one is red and the other is white
the matches you make when did they turn white from red  
i don't know about two years ago
in two years he turned red into black or should i say red and white  
typhus the plague of our time
killing girls for two years
out
what are you looking at
i need your help
don't make me say it again shall i come in  
first i would like to apologize a lot
i failed to recognize friends in front of my eyes
 and i  enola
i have something to tell you
 okay  you're a little
all day all day i do is endure
if i vote for this lord's bill it will allow ships to put water in the lake
then he votes for planting my forests
i want to stand up and say this is wrong but i have no friends
to do so one must risk everything
so i'm awake and waiting to see which way to go
alone
there's nothing to look for a wife here
because politics has completely used me
that's the story i kept for you
you are a good man
am i a man now  
some time
but i understand your dilemma because i have the same dilemma
i'm sorry we can't talk anymore because i have
a test to solve  
the girl i'm looking for sarah chapman
he has evidence of the girls dying
because of the phosphorus they work with every day
then the factory covers it up as a typhus epidemic
he knows it
so someone tries to kill him
what do we do about it  
we  
 don't open it could be the police  are you still wanted by the police  
 definitely i escaped from jail  you escaped from prison  
forget saying that
there are also bulbs if i don't open the door they will be more suspicious hide
coming
 miss cecily  sorry for coming late at night
no no it doesn't matter i told you to come i need help
 is there anyone else    not
 hmm  good
it's good to be alone we need to talk to you
sir i feel you are a gentleman of good character
and i can trust you
that's why i'm afraid removing my weight in front of you it will be unbearable
miss cecily
well i want to talk to you about a relationship
ah that's it yes maybe we can talk some other time  
please sir
i'm so sorry i am responsible for listening to your story
 let's talk again  thank you
he went his heart is troubled
do not doubt me cecily came to get my help
he told me at the prom that he was trying to change industrial law
he found something something like corruption
what is he doing
enola if you care about that i say absolutely i
i have no crush on anyone but
not this is not the way i meant it
but i have to say when it comes to loving wishes
yes my wish
the reason i don't want to find someone is because i'm busy with politics as i said…
do you like lord tewkesbury  
i heard he was a good man a good reformer
my favorite woman
can't lose my chance
you are not listening
good evening lord tewkesbury
he had no guardian
you have five seconds to explain why you came here
i'm blinded
phosphorus is mixed with oxygen to make matches
i missed everything
he's probably right under your nose
sicily
sarah is cecily
cecily is sarah
enola
enola what the hell
enola did you understand what i said  
or what i didn't say   did you understand what i didn't say  
yes you mean you
you will learn
the message you sent me awanen at the dance that day
what does that mean  
that means i love you
ladies and gentlemen to the future
definitely
they work together lovingly
they had a plan
expose the corruption in the factory stop what his father is doing
they need your help
william lyon invited you to that dance
he's a revolutionary just like you
they need my help you are right
but enola you come in
the police are after you we have a lot to talk about
not i know we have a lot to talk about your highness
you love me
apparently i love you too
do you love me too
you are truly a genius
now call a taxi
 sh you walk loudly  but this is gravel
 your legs are big  i know
stay here keep watch
if someone comes say you're a gentleman
i am a gentleman
they seem to accept it
ok
you
 what a joke you are  am i kidding  
i said stand aside and be safe
now you have escaped from jail and the police are after you
did you hurt i'm very sorry
didn't you hurt
apparently not
hmm
i wonder who taught you to fight like that
our mother needs to answer another question
he wants to feed me like you two i think
wait why are you here is this my test or yours  
both i know how the grail marked your fingers
oxidized phosphorus dust
take it from the table and put it on the knife
you are innocent
did you doubt it  
nothing is right until proven
your test
my adversary his mark
came here
that means our tests are related
shall we go
william lyon
sarah's love
my thief thinly crowned cap
don't be emotional there is nothing we can do for him
we need to keep our minds clear our eyes sharp
he has been caught
 yes it has been tested  the documents he took  
a knife  
no a big one
a short broadsword
heavy shoe feet
scratched made from a hammer with an iron bottom
grail
but on whose terms  
someone else has been here
this cigar had a holder
marks of wool
astrakhan the finest wool
mr mcintyre it would be nice to go to lunch wouldn't you  
let me stay please they are waiting
where did william steal from  
 from the treasury office    yes
from the office of lord macintyre minister of the treasury
how did you think that  
i think william stole the evidence
that lyon and mcintyre are conspiring together
 corruption  yes
because of greed
macintyre secretly profited from the factory
they changed the match mix to cheaper phosphors
it is fatal
enola  
enola i was worried about you
you left me in the dark i'm a little more…
 sherlock holmes   how  not the time
oh my
 he  don't be emotional
 who did this    sir macintyre
 not  but everything fits
no one has ever sat in this chair there are no marks on the carpet no dents
this cigar is smoked but cold
see not new
 there is not even a lip of this glass  absolutely right
these clues are left for us to find
keep us away from the real criminal
all this was planned
who
not mcintyre but somebody those papers are going to lose a lot
someone who knows they are using them to threaten
my opponent
someone who likes to play
 did they get what they wanted    no i do not think
poor william
hmm
 they have taken something  this is the music of this house
god's truth
one of the bible or a myth
dramatic  
god means the upper part of the theater
the balcony
doesn't everyone know that  
this is not music
this is a map
asking to clarify about what we face in the future
there may be some violence you've been through it before
yes
i am wearing a piece of protective clothing
but yes fighting is
yes
 have you fought before    yes a lot of fighting
he fought with swords for the school
hmm
ok can you teach me how to fight  
what this time   inside a cart  
didn't i teach you how to dance in a bathroom in five minutes  
ok good
there are two secrets to fighting dodge the blow counterattack
i don't see how two secrets wow
your first lesson
come on
come on
your second one you didn't block the attack
 i can't hit a girl  please
i oh
come on will it stop  
i can't stop
we are close now
i want more of this lesson
x is in our place
sara
everything is there
we need all the evidence
contract between lyon and mcintyre
change to phosphorus
what william stole for you
the pages taken from the register of the factory
those are the ones you stole from the office
these are the names of the girls they killed
i couldn't forget them
these are the proofs say matchmaking girls are dying because of factory work
they already knew it
you are a good investigator enola holmes
you too sarah chapman
i will share this with the world i promise
thank you
now we need to find william he was supposed to meet me here six hours ago
i'm sorry william won't be coming
what
i'm very sorry
i am very sorry
i told him we have everything
we just have to publicize
he said no one cares unless someone with power says so
he was trying to protect me
now i lost him
we must go quickly or you will be lost too
lose this
get lost in that
 everything seems to be lost  bessie
you all are very inconsiderate
i will take them
let him go
give me a letterwriter and i will
run bessie
don't stand there
come on
follow them
come on
block counter
tewkesbury
ah
ah
do not
bessie
to run
i mean run
enola
you have more than i thought
haha
where will we meet  
definitely
i have always loved theater
got it
i had a dream to be on this stage
you still can't get rid of me
viscount tewkesbury basilweather nobleman
enola
hooray
are you ok
you were born to fight
best wishes
sir macintyre what are you doing here
i was asked to come
your brother found out i want to give justice to the right people
so i don't know how to thank you
about taking back government property
also for exposing this murderer
there are corrupt people in our positions
the world needs to know the name enola holmes
i will take care of it
lestrade arrest this girl
he didn't do anything wrong
what's wrong sir  
 to steal  it's true that he stole from you
he took personal information
he used them to extort money and threaten
that is why he should be punished
ah
but you are wrong
he didn't threaten you
i told you to come here get that guy out
accounting is very good
a chaotic network but it comes to one pocket
one person gets all the fruit
don't let anyone know
hear everything see everything
missed years
everyone plays
all this is a game
it's fun once you know the rules
miss meera troy
hilarious
i don't believe it
it's amazing the things that can be done
when people underestimate you
then came the problem
william stole the contract
he threatened to stop your money train
you couldn't do it
you took the grail took the file
but things got out of hand
so you tried to send us to her majesty macintyre
a rare misstep in your game
moriarty
original account moriarty $16600
original account meera troy $16600
what a shame our little dance comes to an end mr holmes
i enjoyed it a lot
you too enola
miss troy are you after this  
of course you will never find a better board of workers
i just wanted to get the contracts back
although i could not ask william direct questions
you were very kind
if you want to talk to william you should always try
unfortunately he is smarter and braver than i thought
both of them things that don't need their deaths
but superintendent grail is a blunt instrument
you
how did you abuse your position
did i take advantage  
what are my advantages  
treated like an ordinary employee even with twice as much brain as you
more than any of you
why am i sharing your sickness with the rich born on your day  
and punish you at the same time  
why can't i get a gift for what i can do  
where is my place in this society  
i am a woman
i can't join unions
i can't own shares
i can't be as high as them
so
i found my way
it's fun
lestrade
take him
yes sir
what's wrong sir  
 extortion of money  ah right
intimidation murder
let's go
sad that our dance is over
at least for now
maybe we will meet again
not
not
so that's right
i accidentally set my things on fire what about that  
you are corrupt sir
and hundreds of matchmaking girls were involved in the deaths
where is your proof
good
back to work
 sir you can't  tewksbury
be patient
will win
all these names all lives
i failed enola
do not say that
this is gone
william went
they will get away with it
you heard him where's the evidence  
what do we have now  
we have each other
and we have the truth
you're late bessie chapman a penny is cut
oh
you don't work here anymore
what are you doing hey
come down
coming down
let him talk
a few weeks ago
this is isley william lyon and i
tried to prove something
prove that this factory is killing people
they know it
but they decided that profit was more important than what we did
 you're coming with me  shh
it's not typhus that's killing us it's phosphorus
what we work on every day
you lying little rag
a penny is cut from your paycheck
these are our friends
our sisters
our children
now it stops
it is time for us to use what we have that's us
now is the time to strike
now is the time to say no
 okay back to work  no
you get out of here don't try to come back
you don't work here anymore
will you join me  
think about your families
don't do that girl
don't take the risk
this is
are you coming
this is what happens in the world
please girl
i know you are scared me too
but this is the only power we have
ok
start that machine again and go to work
ok
do not
this cannot be their future
i'm sorry enola
stop that
stop that
be one voice
that's enough
stop it
can't anyone control these crazy women  
great girl
 where are you going    westminster
here they go
there's a good sound here
he likes to cause trouble doesn't he  
it's like he was made that way
he still has to cut his hair
it looks like your body has learned to fight
his highness macintyre is in custody guilty of ministerial corruption
sir macintyre
definitely
he is not my boyfriend
enola holmes: pay as much as you can for the detective service
pay as much as you can
what do people pay you for   potatoes and thanks  
that's all they have
can withstand fluctuations that's where i want to go
also edith said she would think about the rent
you know if you want better surroundings i can
i thought
holmes and holmes  
a joint venture  
this is a kind suggestion
but if i do i'll always be in your shadow
hmm yes
but i like your new look
no one should be alone
it's good to have a friend
maybe i should write it down
i will come and check on you
i like that
maybe you can come to baker street every now and then
see about me
maybe we'll put it on thursday at 4pm
thursday at 4 pm
that means i don't have to bother you today
he has flowers
 sherlock — tewkesbury
 see you on thursday  bye sherlock
 sherlock    yes
your newspaper
thank you
besides
thanks for everything
criminal mastermind on the run  meera troy  aka moriarty
tewksbury when did i show you that i love flowers  
these are called spreading bellflowers
attracted to old woods thin flattering
no law abiding
but their petals are so sweet her flowers
two things
your parable is a pain and i have no soft petals
more and more
this was an invitation to a ball dance
hmm i'm not going to prom with you in the last one i was arrested
there's every reason to dance again what do you say  
 you are such a genius  you are a coward
how can you talk to a woman like that   you are a disgrace sir
but still you hold my hand
but still i'm holding your hand
the match girl strike led by sarah chapman was the first industrial action by a woman for women
it improved their working conditions forever
it only takes one flame to start a fire
there is more part of the movie so stay tuned
thursday at 1 pm 3:59
thursday at 1 pm 4:00 pm

hello rajkumari ji
sorry i
it's not your fault
in kochi
it goes when he wants
and uncle padam you must have come earlier like always
do you remember my name after all these years  
i remember the stories you told me
the little lady is waiting for you in the palace
dear mishri
i have written many letters to you before
but i never had the courage to send them
i thought you would never forgive me
good to see you too misha
welcome
welcome home
hi rukmini
look how big you've grown
i was very scared when the train was late
i was coming to receive you
anyway
padam must have taken care of you
god brought two people together
ratanu and commander
his dog is just like vali's
before his car arrives he goes and sits near the gate
rukmini
where is dad
don't get confused by this
he had to go there because the workers of our salt farm were on strike
but to be honest
tried hard stay here
but don't worry
will come in two or three days
until then i will stay and erase the desolation
come on
i will show you to your room
no one is allowed to touch anything
ratan was very straightforward about it
everything is the same you
okay i'll see you at midnight
i have a confession to make
i was very curious about you
so i searched online about you
but you are nowhere
i mean not even in any social network on the internet
nowadays it's
seems strange
there was really nothing to share
after mother's death
after my accident
all i could see was hatred
about father
about you
i blamed you for everything
look i'm sorry
i had no intention to separate your family
that's not what i wanted
come on
let me show you something
ratan only had these memories of you
watched this video again and again
since the day you left here
it was as if ratan's time had stopped since then
he blamed himself
gayathri's suicide
more about your accident
wrote letters to you
i tried to call youbut
your anger stopped him
after that he spent all his time looking after the misha fund
he was really happy
because you're coming back home
so why isn't he here  
hi you are talking to ratan singh gaikode
i have no way of answering your call at this time
leave a message and i'll call you back
father  
father  
father  
father  
misha
misha
misha can you hear me  
misha
welcome to the real world
no no don't get up
you are in shock
thank god you are fine misha
if something happened to you
you scared the crap out of us
alone tonight
what did you think
i saw my father
ratan has gone out for work right  
isn't that so rukmani  
yes
are you sure misha  
he was wearing the same coat
of the magician
with his magic hat
i followed him
up to the stairs
does that mean that ratan will come back and hangi muttang with all of us  
i know what i saw
misha you must have seen kapil
our estate manager
he came this evening
your screams were heard even by our quartos
you were unconscious when the three of us came running
did you see anyone else there  
 no ma'am  why don't you understand  
i know he is here
ok
ok
calm down
there is nothing wrong with rukmini watching a little
misha's heart will also be changed
madam i looked everywhere and there is no one here
good
hand
i saw his shadow in the water
ok if you say
no that's enough
let's go
this great night should have been on the side of the fort
demons and ghosts come to drink water
do you think this is funny  
no not like that
you must have seen your own shadow
i'm sorry dr shekhawat
 we bothered you this great night  mrs rukmani
what's wrong with saying sorry for causing trouble  
give me the medicine he needs a good sleep
 padam singh take the car  it doesn't matter
i will walk
but
come on
can you add sugar ma'am  
shame on you
do you know where father went  
ma'am i work in the kitchen
maybe kapil ji knows
he looks after all the husband's work
misha
how are your  
seems fine
not ready yet
why
skeet shooting
your father's favorite sport
polonaye used to do it
arts
but after falling while riding the horse and getting injured
it stopped
skeet shooting became his new favorite sport
boys are his toys
i don't understand them at all
wow you are awesome rj
i can do it with my eyes closed
nice to meet you
your highness
the real queen of mayagarhi has come
i heard
mom
you are beautiful
rana jai ​​singh
 your cousin  a distant cousin
a long way off
raja ji has not come today
and who will challenge me  
are any of you right  
kapil
yes
today he will participate for us
so kapil
will the honor of the king be saved  
will try
but today i am a bit nervous because i am in front of you
that's how you learn isn't it  
 yes  congratulations guys
that's not it a small party is thrown on friday
you two come too
 really    yes
what happiness
i want to win definitely
even if the empire is gone greatness is still there
what  
come ashokji come sit down
i was waiting for you
 how is rukmini    i'm fine
sit down
this is not misha
ratan's daughter
i have seen it as a child
this is sp ashok tanwar
but not for long right  
are you going to get a promotion  
wow
the best police officer in town
very lucky isn't it sp sir  
what to do
people like us have to work hard ranaji
not everything comes easily
i was joking sp sir
don't arrest me
and if things are found easily they are found
you can also take advantage of such privileges
isn't it queen  
now if you two ladies will let me
i'll show you how to do it
chic
rana mr
it looks like he will be defeated by the king's priest
you need to see a doctor
raj kumari g
no not that bad
my best time is using blanks in scrit shooting
without real bullets
what happened to your rifle all of a sudden  
congratulations to your mr rana
as the bullet was put in the mouth the bullet came back
the mistake is mine
people like rana can't stand it when someone like me comes to stand equal to him
the king is not like that at all
so what's it like  
he always says
if you do a little good it will never go to waste
it's always it'll always make a difference somewhere
yes
my connection with your generation is very old
come on
i was 10 years old
came to steal this palace
i was caught
but do you know what the king did  
i was not scolded and did not even call the police
put your hand on my head
i was given another chance
all the expenses for my studies were taken care of by your foundation
 give  what  
give me a hand
rajkumari ji
so you know
where is father  
actually i went to court instead of the king regarding a property case
when i come back
kapil
yes  
is everything going well between father and rukmini  
rajkumari ji
from here it looked like the royal palace
there are many
although i was close to the king
nothing is known about your personal life
finally i don't have an answer to your question
shall we go
now it's my turn
absolutely honey
come and join
come together
the whole house was kept awake since last night
i have a hard time understanding
why don't you understand  
some other things in this house
no one has an answer to that
i am afraid that something has happened to my father
miss misha i checked the entire palace right in front of you
nothing was found
nobody saw anything
i saw
is that enough  
i didn't say that
listen to yourself
on the one hand you say that you saw the king on the balcony
if you saw that how did you disappear  
if he disappeared
who did you see  
ok
then you tell me where he is
why is his phone off  
it can be anything
maybe i should not say this in front of mrs rukmini
but you don't know much about the king
i know
some of his works are very famous
ask him
catch it sir
no say it yourself
say what you mean directly
to tell you the truth we have received such false complaints before
where is the king
can't meet the phone is also off
things like
then we found
that he is staying with another woman
ashok
please don't
see this is all i know father called me here now he has disappeared
okay so you write a complaint about a missing person
do it now
ok
but for that miss misha you have to come to the police
no one here cares about this at least you help me
i didn't say no
but the police have some rules

you destroyed this house once i won't let it happen a second time
do you understand  
getting out of my room
stepping out of my room
get out of my room
i can't believe you could be so stupid misha
just because i was good to you doesn't mean you can push your boundaries and work
plspls

i want to talk to dad
ohohoh

rajkumari ji
raj
come quickly i have a call for you
rajkumari ji
a call from the king
here comes your mixture
misha is your father
talk
say hi
mishri
how long have i been waiting until today  
all my hopes were lost
 your voice  dad  
i can't hear your voice son
the network seems to be messed up here
hello  
hello
mishri
i am so glad i sent you that letter
i won't let you go anywhere this time
i will come soon
then let's have dinner together
love
i love you son
are you happy  
i was confused when i saw you
what happened
why aren't you happy  
your father is fine
misunderstandings can happen to kanaik misha ji
but the most important thing is that the king says well
that's not dad
but you yourself spoke to him
at first i also thought
that's dad
but then he
to tell the truth
i haven't heard from him in years
so how do i know  
it can be anyone
but why would anyone do such a thing  
i don't know
this is all i know
i need to get out of this maze
do you know what they teach first in psychotherapy  
get to the root of your fear
since i came here
everything scared me
it is from them that i get answers to everything
miss misha
i don't understand what we are looking for
kapil
yes  
it is the king's
but mrs misha she drove this car once
how do you know when that coughlin has fallen  
because this was in his hand yesterday
kapil killed his father
mrs misha
it makes sense
scares me confused
that is what rukmini wants to be
i'm starting to doubt myself
then everyone thinks that my mental level is not in a good place
that's what he wants
queen why do you do such a thing mrs misha  
maybe because of the property
kapil
my father's body was here yesterday
that means this is somewhere
but if so
commander (dog) finds the king by himself
you know that too
someone is with rukmini
he can't do this alone
let's do one thing
there is a party at rana's house tonight
everyone goes there
you should go there too
we have to go
kapil
what business did rana and father do together  
from the day rana sold his palace
he was aware of everything about the king
also about rukmini
i don't know that
but i know that the queen does not like rana at all
it may be showing falsely
that was the day of skeet shooting
i noted that there must be something between ashok and rukmini
people say
there was a time when sp ashok loved queen
some say it is still the same today
that's why he never got married
it was dr shekhawat
your cousin
but the queen is very close
maybe because of the money
actually since the day you came
people are asking questions about you too
don't you think so  
what are you doing here
i am
i made a mistake
i will go
you're not going anywhere
he is with me
rukminirukminirukmini
you disappoint me
i think it would be better if you were a little more openminded
you know not in the old days
think like me
i always say
tradition culture royalty are all there in those places
but everyone is welcome in my house
even your staff
 what's your name    kapil
kapil
you lost to him at least you should remember the name
huh  
cheers
i want to introduce you to someone important
 actually i'm going now no no
you can't go you're coming with me
please forgive us thank you
come on let's go come on
i'm in trouble do you understand that    keep your voice down
what do you mean to reduce the noise  
you said you would solve this
now this has gone too far
is this your idea  
don't blame me for that
i will give you time till tomorrow
i was caught
revealing all your secrets
i really mean it
no that poor queen
she made my life hell i will cut oki's neck
what the hell
i will talk later
hey
are you two following me  
going to go from here
we came to say that we know about your transaction
now we go to the police
 to the police    yes
that's a great idea my friend
i will come too come on let's all go
why  
you all know about this dill
do you know
i helped your father
the idea to make a good hotel out of those ruins was mine
at first it is now gone
now i'm screwed
look at me just look at me
look at my million dollar face
father is not missing
he is dead
that old man does not die easily
they are going with two or three people
i know
you and rukmini together killed him
are you crazy  
i took a loan of 50 crores for the hotel
do you understand
if that old man dies
chic
chic
i'm done
take a breath take a good breath
there's still time
take a breath take a breath
i play this i know about this
wait a minute
to you
you can sign those documents
what  
thought we were stupid  
you need rukmini's signature not misha's
i don't want the signature of that cheating woman
the king really
you have the most ownership don't you  
right  
aren't you helping your brotherinlaw  
ok for the past
please i am not very far away
how many more stories are made up  
there is no story deiyam palla
the king has come to my house and has eaten a lot
i know everything about his last will
isn't this what you talked about with the queen at the party  
not
there is a rumor
your queen is pregnant
that child is not the king's
do you think we will believe anything you say  
come on
if the child was the king's
rukmini will shout to the world and say
the king is very proud of his royal blood
who
who are you
not
not not
do not do not
nothing happened
nothing happened
nothing
where is it
the king
always suspected about ashok and the queen
there is something in it
who suspects a police officer  
kapil  
this dress
the king gave me
he had a tailor in jaipur
one day
i stood looking at him
his style his personality
at once he called me and told taylor
listen
ask kapil to sew a suit like mine
i am sorry
i forgot
i'm not the only one
that he is worried about him
misha
say yes
what  
oh baby
calm down honey
i am at the factory i will come home soon
what
the king and queen's royal bed
i think
who else sleeps in this bed  
people you know
people who are willing to do anything when you say
so i wonder
whose child is this  
what did you say
i said whose child is this
you are trying to hide so much
i know it's not dad's
you are affected by matters that have nothing to do with you
there is still time
get out of here
gone are the days of going back
 misha  queen
mr ashok is talking he said it is an emergency
hello

uncle padam
uncle padam
someone helps rukmini
he cannot do these alone
scares me
confusing
there is something in it
this is what rukmini wants
show that i'm starting to doubt myself
everyone will think that i am mentally unstable
but why would the queen do something like that  
sometimes to property
it's over
there was a mistake my lord
king
the wretch
 leave him alone  why you  
rukminirukmini
rukmini is thrown out
put it out put it out
put out
what are you doing crazy  
take control of yourself and come to your senses
what are you doing
i can't do that
i can't do it anymore kapil
you can rukmini you can
think about us
think about our future
think about our child
can you  
can you  
yes
this is not the time to be confused
you take care of ashok
everything will be fine
i love you
come here come here
i'm sorry i'm sorry
i'm sorry  enough
enough rukmini
rukmini
after he came here his condition worsened
you know that
i tried my best to stop him
but he was stubborn that he would go back
and when padam didn't come back i was worried
that's why i sent kapil to find him
as soon as i went to the station i came to know that he had not come there
where did he go to board the train  
around 11:00 pm
the last train from morbi departs at 11:30
it takes two hours to go to the station from here
i
no sir
he must have gone around 9
i remember well
because i loaded his stuff into the car
he is right
really ashok
things are happening in my head these days
that's why i don't remember anything
you wait for me in the car
ok
ok
you tried to say something
tell the truth
rukmini you can trust me
ashok
i am afraid
you find misha
 jai hind sir  jaya hind
sad thing is
after so many years misha came to see the king
but they could not meet
it is fate
sir

one dead body was found in the car
this will take some time
you go
i will tell you as soon as i find the body
ok
 bhavesh  yes

to scrub every inch of the pond
ok sir

since when am i talking  
calm down rukmini
ashok was looking at me
the police found the car
but they found only one dead body
padam's
 only suede    yes
and misha  
misha's body  
misha's body will also be found where will he go

hello  
i am afraid
please hurry up and come back

how much did i try to talk to you  
where are the others  
an accident happened
everyone should go to the police and answer
what
last night misha
he has to go back
padam's body has been found
misha
he has not been found
rukmini
a dead girl cannot die again
what
for a dead girl  
misha committed suicide a week ago
his body was found in the lake along with the vehicle
i just came from mumbai
i saw his body in the morgue
did you commit suicide  
yes
that can't happen
he was here you saw him
i can't imagine either
i can't understand anything myself
there must be something wrong with this
that can't happen
 trust me  it can't be
 rukmini  no
not that can't happen
that is impossible
please rukmini
suicide  
rukmini  
misha  
misha  
i am not misha
who are you
what is your name son
fatima
remember one thing
nothing that is crushed is ever wasted
fatima
i could never forget what he said
after many years fate met me once again with that gentleman's daughter
he changed my life
but his own daughter's life
totally broke
there was only one relationship between mishai and his father
dr shekhawat
he wanted to help misha
but he saw no other way
misha coming to the hospital to meet me
there must be a reason
fatima  
maybe life gave me a chance to repay the debt to the family that helped me so much
but it was not so easy
misha's heart was full of pain and hatred
he thought he was alone in this world
from the drugs he was stuck on for so long
he tried to come out
but little by little misha and i became friends
our friendship also grew
he started trusting me
he saw his father through my vision
he wanted to give his father a chance
hello  
dad
misha
father and misha were going to meet after so many years
finally i felt that everything was going well between them
the number you are calling is out of coverage area
but fate had a different plan
misha was waiting for him that day
but he didn't come
one daughterhis faith was broken again
it took his life
because he thought his father didn't love him
then you sent this letter
come back home
when ratan doesn't call
i knew something was wrong
i don't trust anyone here
so we made a plan
i got mixed up and came here
because then we can know the truth
because
what i did was wrong
i was wrong
shouldn't have done that
never
please forgive me
i should not have done that
i made a mistake
i am guilty
i am guilty
save my child
no kapil kapil nopls
please
 doctor get up  think about your child
you said to think about us
we don't need any of this
 let's go  this is all mine
my
rukmini
kapil
will you kill me
will you kill me
i should have done this a long time ago
rukmini
what are you doing are you crazy  
let me go
all this can be ours
yours not ours
you did all this for yourself
only for you
rukmini
rukmini
rukmini rukmini
rukmini
rukmini
rukmini
rukmini
stop
so you finally picked up a weapon
we are the same fatima
both of us were elevated by the king's kindness
right  
come let me tell you a story
don't get too close
there was a 20yearold boy
one day he was bold enough to pull off the king's most valuable garment
do you know what the king did  
shame on him by taking off his clothes in front of everyone
 stopping  insulted him
stop
he said that you are not worth even the stitches of these clothes
then i understood
he said that he did these things for sacrifice and not for kindness
and i understood this too
people like us will never receive things if they don't take them away
so what did you get  
what did you get from doing all this  
you lost everything
you forgot kapil
in every good and bad decision you make
that there may be consequences
because of your husband rana
this was put in the mouth of the gun to prevent the bullet from escaping
that night i thought
is it wrong for me to come here  
what is the meaning of all this  
so many lives were lost for what  
for some landfor some money
last morning
dr shikatu and i went back to the palace
with some children of misha foundation
then i understood
there is nothing wrong with me coming here
this abandoned palace
now these children belong
wherever misha and big man are they must be happy today

# from honorsociety(2022)websrt
do you like my
like my stuff  
this is all nonsense
i don't care about these
but these are the gods of my people
so either i worship them or i'm a bully
these pictures like the ones on my social media
there is one reason so people are jealous of me
girls want to be my friend boys want me anyway
i am having a lot of fun right  
this must be the only real thing here
the handmaid's tale (novel tv series)
the story is about a woman named offred
trapped in an oppressive maledominated society
he has no control over his own destiny
unlike offred i have control over my destiny
i'm going out
in my house this is fine but i eventually give up
that is the best
breakfast to go
banana bread just the way you like it
thank you mom
this is janet my mother according to her bread is love
hmm
good morning dad
if you say so
my dad marvin works three jobs
a white whale house that means an ugly giant of wood
 the floor is beautiful father  the last bit
 the work will be finished soon  it won't happen
it is his dream that he will finish it
that he will rest for a while
that day will never come
marvin you're late for work
i know
 did you hear what i said    i heard
 i know  you heard
these two people made me wrong once
ea
i am a senior
i worked all my life to get here
everything is fine
i want to escape this year
then get my golden pass at wonka's factory
like offred in the handmaid's tale
i don't show who i really am
escape from the crowd
hello
i hide inside myself
tommy danny texted me last night
 can i have an amen    amen
 did you answer him    definitely not
he's in high school and i'm taking care of my hands
for a real man
i don't count any of that
do you mind if i send him a picture  
talia and emma
the most popular girls in school
not
they get everything when they keep me as a friend
inside this hell without more
they have to work with me
hmmm
my goodness
hey girl
 thanks for the help  okay
 here's an ad for my show  i didn't ask
an ad is like a tweet but destroys the environment
ah
i will tweet it
we have to go see mr calvin sing right  
of course
do you promise  
horner i'll see you later in my office
tell the big news
did mr calvin wink at you  
yes get bored
but the big news is good
selfie
mr calvin is my future mentor
and the key to everything but let these two escape
then i will tell you about the background
see you later
 love it  really
they really don't
to me high school means one thing
getting out of high school
delete this first chapter it is not necessary
the student newspaper was taken out of the school's budget
millions of years ago so last year i volunteered
create a new one online
editorinchief of the school newspaper
that's good for my record book
i am the captain of the volleyball team
it's not a big game for this school
but i am not a natural athlete
fortunately for me this is a good team
travis biggins
in another dimension he could be my lover
if i wanted him i could have had him
but there is no time for love
apart from volleyball and newspaper
i started a food bank for the economically disadvantaged
i also started a school karate club
but my symptoms did not decrease
ms felson i think there is a mistake here
i don't think so horner
ah you're right this is not yours
if that's the case i'm out of my head
he is one of the good teachers
now you're thinking he can go to college without any trouble
this girl has nothing to worry about
wait i'll show you why you know nothing
miss felson we're not far
went to university i think at smith's
graduated like last century
talked about every reason at the dinner table
from salad rejection to women's rights
he wants to change the world
come back here and watch his future die
go
coach biggins
you know you guys are so slow
i call this group old ladies
but the old ladies were like no way we're not that slow
he's from here went to syracuse university
a lacrosse scholarship
you should wave like this
one man
wow
i can't believe it's the same person
dah
why are you waiting
get out of here
now look with her baby travis
go
so kids what did we learn  
not only going to university
make sure you don't come back after that
everyone i respect is at a good university
so getting a good education is useless
it's about fame relationships
this place opens many doors
for situations that cannot be tolerated by secondrate people
for intellectuals like the person who wrote this book
achieve his goals i'm going there too
it's a fouryear plan
it's almost over now
i think the second scroll is the last horner
that's great that's good
all thanks
ree i'm tuning in ree status
re re re re
all thanks to you mr calvin
i mean without you i don't know
how important is my college essay  
choose a good one
not stop
you know horner if i may use an analogy
i like to say it's like i'm teaching a music class
but you sing the song
that's a good analogy
that's another thing we have in common
we will finish this very soon
examples of each other
now let's look at your list of universities again
i know
why am i following this guy  
here's a clue
this is the place i want to go
harvard
the name of this school is success
 earned success  unearned success
it doesn't matter
this is my ticket out of this hell
and don't be responsible like this
like this one
ok i look at your list
looks like you missed one
don't you want to go to harvard  
i would love to go there
but i don't think i will get a chance to go there
you are not wrong
the participation rate is about 5%
 46%  46% yes
but i have a surprise horner
many people don't know this but i have contacts there
really  
this gentleman here howie kaplan
my best friend since high school
a very successful harvard alumnus
a funder
wow i don't know about that
i learned about this in namaya class
we were very close even though we didn't leave
to the same college
we started our own band without instruments
your own scale
aol was big in those days
what is aol  
my god
i can tell you a few stories honor
wow
i love to hear them
one time we went to st louis
a music competition without ribbons
harvey stole a phone from the hotel
can't be
crazy time mr calvin
we were a crazy group back then
we returned the phone but it didn't help
but because harvey is close to me
he likes to use his power
give my best and brightest student a good look
at the entrance test
it's not a responsibility but a little push
as rare as it is this is my best chance
that's why i bring you big news horner
my god you say
yes
all the time of my life
i worked my best until this opportunity came
you are in my top four
wait you mean the first four  
yes
are you ok
yes
yes
i can't imagine
i mean getting into the top four
it is more than expected
p p
i tune in
i have made a big mistake
this vicar thinks he loves me
i thought i would use it to my advantage
but being submissive is not enough for him
he wants another motivation from me
i am very pleased mr calvin
thank you very much for looking at me
wait where are you going  
don't you want to know who the contestants are  
god no no no
i don't want to interfere in any kind of competition
with my friends especially…
i know you will choose the right one
see you
i'm not lying
this is a setback but i don't want him
who are my competitors for two reasons
one he doesn't have to say
among the underachievers in this school
only three people can get there
two when i had them out of the way
i don't want him to suspect me that i am involved in this
i worked hard for a long time
this is another hurdle to overcome
when life gives others lemons lemonade is made
when life gives me lemons i sell them for a dollar
for an idiot who doesn't know i got them for free
i can't imagine him to you
horner said that it will not be given
makes a sad face
i don't have time to be sad
they are emma no time to be sad
this semester marks are the last bit
want to go to college affects symptoms
so i want them to score less in every class
from now until the end
i thought you were the smartest in our class
no no i'm either three or four
yes i thought so too three or four
we know who is among the first two
he's awesome
a loser i say
a loser at best
he is right travis is cool
the captain of the lacrosse team a beautiful girlfriend (lacrosse = a sport)
bringing good signs
he doesn't get upset easily
talia how long have christine and travis been together  
since the second year
 i remember because  i trust you
look find out what they do
maybe the guy doesn't get what he wants
but who do we ask  
christine
if anything
he is the one reading about it
if nothing happens
he is the one reading about it
what about the other two  
he is the one to be right  
kennedy park
the girl is in her own world and wears strange clothes
today he is dressed as marie curie
the scientist who discovered radium
i know it he's about it
facebook was left
what kid still uses facebook  
he got two likes for that photo
one from mother the other from grandmother
even our history teacher didn't recognize it
but he is unfortunately very talented
what do we do about him  
give him a boyfriend
first we'll have to sweep away his cobwebs
 sorry  sorry
we will listen
finally
my mistake
michael dypnicki first in class
as stupid as possible
no friends no life no lunch
he is the easiest
find out about christine
i'll go and try to find kennedy a boyfriend
he likes you
maybe you can talk him into anything
ok i will call him and ask him to step aside
i know it's hard to believe
but i saw him in the locker room
 he's a buried treasure  not just looks
i know
besides i don't trust you
look at it this way when you lose your virginity
the second time you can sell
i'm not a virgin
ok
i can't fight upstream at short range
with the aesthetic appreciation of young children
i'm sure later in life she'll get a man think
adam's family is the best he can do
but if you are in this school it will be a few more years
he has to be alone until he is ready
no it's not okay for a guy to mess with kennedy
hey kennedy how are you  
 this is private  i didn't ask you anything
i'll tell you upfront this is personal
ok we'll leave it at that
let's move on to other beliefs
dipniki it's easy to say about him for four years
animal signs bring the other person
he definitely gave me signals
he doesn't want me especially
he wants someone a girl
imagining a naked actress
show and teach where to put it
it doesn't take much to throw him out
hey diesel
hey horner
hey would you do me an honor   (honor = honor = respect)
do to me
god you are brilliant
hey would you like to switch assistants with me  
i understand
you want to be my lab assistant
no no i want to change assistants
it doesn't make any sense
you have to help this idiot
i know i'm doing this for talia
he likes you
ok tell me horner
see you later idiot
i'll go find chemistry baby
how are you girl
i hope you don't mind this
chemistry sucks for me anyway
talia reads the entire class on time
ok
if academic success is your main goal
i will be your best choice
ok
today we're talking about bonds
we make chemical bonds using heat
signs
boy that's my girl right  
looks beautiful today
did you tell diesel i like you  
 because he's after me  not no time
uh uh uh uh
what did you find out from christine  
it's really great
he said that he should take care of her until marriage
my goodness that's so cute
i know
hmm look at travis
in front of him is a chest
they are really nice young busts
he avoids them
my god
you know when solving a puzzle
looking for the missing piece
it seems to take a long time
then eventually it will be found but you will look then
about the next part this continues
suddenly you see the picture
i don't like pirulu but two birds
going to fall with one stone
down
pronunciation comes from the fire of the tongue

drama society people go
when there is nowhere else to go
hey miss felson
horner what are you doing here  
i want to join
last year   a little late
you remember gary
he is the wolf this is it
his little nest
i really want to work behind the scenes
background design lighting whatever
my goodness
wait nice to meet you
we always need people behind the scenes
ok
nice to have you here
i always thought we could be friends
on saturdays we go bowling
but we don't tell everyone
ok
bowling game with drama kids
with people who don't even know what it is  
hey kennedy
ok pay attention listen to this
your chance
ok now even though i'm a faculty advisor
i don't want to use my powers
the two choices are summer awakens
and kennedy's play
ok thank you miss felson well trained
good practice
ok everyone raise your hands
summer awakens
ok i think that is the majority opinion
kennedy i'm so sorry maybe next year
that's right you're leaving here
maybe at university
ok there are screenings starting tomorrow
but to everyone in this association
priority is given
ok let's go everyone the curtain opens in three weeks
that means a little time
hey kennedy most importantly
i think your story is beautiful
you didn't read it
of course i read you posted it online
ok
if you read it what was it about  
the play is about mary the first queen of england
how did she get the name lay mary  
protestants were killed
how did he choose by force  
one of love and power
you read it
i read it
you are the only person who read one of my plays
don't your parents read  
not
ok that's sad
i think we went to the drama society
you have to do your play
ok congratulations on that
i make my fortune
this is a beautiful edith cowell dress
a nurse during the war who was killed as a spy
you left facebook
poor girl got used to it regardless
i guess i should have some sympathy
but as i always say
you cannot sympathize without compassion
i won't interfere honor
it's a society made by children
don't you like summer awakens  
i like that
but i like kennedy's play better
did you read it
definitely
isn't that great  
he has his own voice i thought
if we do his play that's a good way
show that you appreciate kennedy
although he is not that popular
you know girls who don't have many friends
boys don't count they are in great pain
women like us don't even know what it's like
no no
i think you feed too much
my goodness
oh dear
miss felson says we have to do kennedy's play
 what    what the hell  
what happened
we can all criticize later right  
but we have to have screen tests we're already late
 shall i say    oh horner  
we can save time if we:
if the role of duke is given to travis biggins
 what    loveable protagonist
why don't we ship the entire product with water  
in a toilet  
every time he comes to the field there are cheers
why are we giving him more attraction  
because it gives us more attraction
i mean girls like him
he is friends with everyone
he can bring the captain of the lacrosse team
a new audience
 do you mean idiots    i'm not talking about people
this is nonsense
he has never done drama we don't give a damn
the main character for him  
hey gary we can't give up on our art
forget it todd
you were in three plays in your whole life
two of them as captain hook
are you really thinking about this  
we need a large audience
as much as possible right  
yes
will it not be good when acting  
in front of people other than art students and our parents  
i thought gary would like this
if i'm right about travis
gary should know more about him than i do
these are all pieces of the puzzle
you will soon see the big picture
kennedy what do you think  
i am  
poor girl
for the first time in my life without any prior notice
someone asks his opinion
what do you think about travis being cast as duke  
ah i don't know
 who is travis    okay horner  
horner you should be the only one in this room
even talked to him
are you asking him  
in out
in out in
oh my friend
i have never acted before
don't think about it i will help
this should be done very carefully
i want travis in this play
but gary has something i don't
a male garment
travis say good night to your boyfriend
come here soon
i have to go my friend
first character meeting tomorrow
in a row let's go
i've always wondered do you think travis
gay gay gay
 let's go  gay
now at this point in the test
paying attention to heat is very important
keep an eye out for it
just like the weeping goddess
what
nothing
the weeping angels are the aliens of doctor who (doctor who = hollywood popular tv series)
if you look away from them they will kill you
i know that
i can't believe you're in doctor who to see
sorry don't take me for a joke
no no no i'm a fan too
i don't take people for granted
who is your favorite doctor  
my matt smith
ah michael i'm sorry
 i'm very sorry  this is my mistake
not that's my mistake it's mine
we have an exam tomorrow
this little incident and what i have planned for today
the first wave of my action series
you see ever since michael became my lab assistant
he added me from all social media networks
i didn't take him in at once
but i know he is waiting to see all my beautiful pictures
it is not arrogance
it's just a fact
now when i press this
i can see michael sitting alone
in front of his computer
studying for the exam when he received this message
instead of learning
he spends his evening in selfindulgence
any girl who doesn't know this is what's going on
dating a guy online he's funny
beth my favorite student are you coming to my next concert  
 these are not jokes right    do not
ok boy
i will call your mother and tell her to take drugs
hey not taking it back won't take it back
do you want to listen to rock music no
hey guys are you coming to see my dua lipa (dua lipa = british singer)
and ted nugent's mash up   (ted nugent = american singer)
not   horner
 hi  hey hi
wow
normal us
you missed my show last week
ah i'm sorry mr calvin i've been busy
your luck
because i'm doing another one
unload sunday night come there
ah my goodness
what  
don't you want to come  
you don't want to disappoint me do you  
i was joking
you can't let me down if you don't let me down
um
 i will come  ok
i'll take you backstage after the show
god i will continue to make amends
even though he thought it was not a crime
are you happy
this is like a child's cinderella dress
sleeping princess
some kid wore this for halloween
their parents donated this
reducing this is not even in the history
these are the last
apparently no one will give it to us
money to rent new clothes
so we are stuck with these
it's a mess
due to these the authenticity of the drama is lost
we do not use these
everything is confused by these
what else can we do  
i mean we can't even make new ones
 i can  hmm  
i can make clothes like history
i do it every day
yes but they are the same in the whole drama
it cannot be done in three weeks
how is work at your school  
this is more important
see the pieces of the puzzle  
ok i'm fine with this
but we need to do screen tests
and i think we need to find another duke right  
no i don't think so
hey friend how  
what are you waiting for
bring your beautiful ass here
we have work to do
ok everyone come together
i don't know any of you
bread is made from the collected things
i do it all the time with my mom
you have the recipe
measure inputs
follow the instructions
but if you are making bread for the first time
you have no idea if it will taste good
can it be eaten  
i think this bread will be good
haha
this is definitely not the best remake
mary's coronation gown but it's very similar
as much as i can
that's great kennedy
but you are tired
this is how i always look
ok everyone i need the essay assignment
please send them here
 could it have been done today    yes
maybe you can give later
do people do that  
yes
 take it here  thank you
what comes at number six  
hmm it is the last assignment before the exam
so going back to the bread parable
i think this dough needs a little more yeast
hey michael i was wondering what are you doing tonight  
studying
i know it's a lot of trouble
but can you study with me  
i have a few questions
about the laws of chemical bonding
yes ok if that's
you might be thinking how far does this guy go  
the answer is it's a short distance because you don't have to go
is horner there  
hi michael
ok thank you dad come in
nice to meet you sir
i love burger land
then electrons are transferred in covalent bonds
no actually they are shared
 okay  shifts in ions
ok ok
yes for some reason i
i can't quite grasp it
ah this pen is finished
ah this doesn't matter either
you know you'll break the tip
one more time
how was your assignment yesterday  
i did well
i revealed a little secret
what  
this is
do you really need help with chemistry  
what are you saying
i feel like you're pretending not to know
for things you already know
not like that
i really need help
i see you got an a on your assignment today
i'm sorry i wasn't more open
i think you're really smart
sometimes you make me look like a fool
it is like that for many people
i don't think people feel that way
i think people are stupid in their own way
you idiot
you know you're smart
this is a good book
really   have you read
yes
you know i think that's part of it
the details are like a speech
feeling trapped in one's own society
a wish for a better life
god if only i could make it this year
tock tock
here's pecan suzuni bread with hot chocolate
for those who work
 thanks mom  thank you mrs rose
so
michael
michael tell me about yourself
what do your parents do
mom we are studying
he has one minute to speak
 maybe i know mom  i do not think
sorry these are delicious
let's study at your house next time
can't
i mean i don't get food like this in my house
did you see horner   not so bad here
 so michael  mom
we need to start working again
ok ok
enjoy the food
 your mother seems fine  he's the last
 okay give it to me  ah
 okay  okay it's here
follow him home  
yes i want to know where he is
i feel he is hiding something
i can't do that because i have theater training
not you don't need to explain
whatever you want i'll make it happen
see you later love
really
here's the thing
hey guys okay  
great
wow this is really nice kennedy
i still can't find a match for the crown
but hydraulic lift would be a good thing
 hydraulic    i'll show you later
i can't believe you have time for these things
i don't have
if i fail english it's because of you
i'm not sure it's my responsibility
that's a joke
 yes i know  i'm super funny
okay breathe with me
now let's do it again
i am the lawful ruler of england
i'm not going away
this crown is from the things that give me
but mary i love you
now take his hand
do you love the crown more than me  
men don't have to choose between power and love
 why does it happen to a woman    no no no grace
send yourself to him and let him hug you right  
you love him right  
let him do whatever he wants even if it means holding back
ok
gagagaga
men don't have to choose between power and love
 why does it happen to a woman    my god no no
get out of there ok take care of this
men don't have to choose between power and love
why does it happen to a woman  
sometimes life gives lemons
sometimes life gives you lemonade
it also has a beautiful umbrella inside
with a small biscuit on the side free of charge
what is this  
this stupid play  
 ah shik  are you okay  
yes i am fine
that's my ego and backbone
did you just say what broke  
my spine
it is the lower back
ok then romeo you have practice
sorry dad i have to go sorry
spine
mind your own business savage
eya this side looks so submissive
yes i can't believe he's here
if we are kidnapped or killed
they will know where we were from the phone lines
it was in the drama true crime
let's hope he's on his way
then we can go home
where did he go
i don't know
i will stop time for you
the next second you tell me to do it
i want to give you the love you've been missing
baby wake up with you
i want to be everything
this will change a lot
tell me what i should do
because i know you can handle it well
much much better than him
thanks a lot
a special sound for a special girl
this one's for you too girl
hey can i get you something to drink  
do not thank you
are you sure  
can't give anything  
actually you have something i want
what is that  
i tried to put those pills in my drink
the drink you brought
i'm not like that
ah ah give them to me
i'm young so you do what i say
then get out of here as fast as you can
stole my heart and soul
rhinophil drug
terrible things
i had no proof that he would drug me
i just listened to my father's advice
he always advises me
never take a drink from a stranger
boys are thieves
they last even more than the bats
they are the thief's boss
even the best
that's why you're mine
thanks for the beer honor
how did you get this from the bar  
i told you it was for you
you have grown so much
they could have given it to you anyway
they must have thought we were a couple right  
because we look the same age
you look so old
yes but i have to be rough at work
you know what i'm saying  
i'm here up on the stage
i can't control my younger self
he wants to jump out
he wants rock music do you know
yes yes that's crazy
isn't that crazy  
i love singing for you horner
i'll drive you home young lady
ah
mr calvin are you okay  
i didn't do this willingly these are dangerous
but i wanted to stop this madman
he doesn't seem to be okay just really sleepy
i will put him in a safe place
is he dead  
if he's dead he won't growl
hi we are live
we help those who are in financial difficulties
it makes me very happy
we love financial hardship
then you didn't find dipniki's place
somewhere on the other side of the factory
yes it's very bad
you are still alive
come on
that makes sense to me
maybe why he doesn't want to study at home
anyway a struggling family in the city
not so unusual
you must do something for me
 it is very important  anything
anything
 dude let's go to the beach  i am coming
you have great lovers
 i'm jealous  diesel is not my boyfriend
i mean looking at travis and christine
i mean there is nothing to compare
yes for them
i know he loves me
wow glad you said it with such confidence
if diesel is on stage with another girl
i don't know how to cope
yes diesel if a girl cums in front of everyone
that's an insult to talia
 but he's not like that  but it can happen
wait
do you like travis in the play  
 with whom    grace
she is the queen
yes he is beautiful
but she is not as beautiful as you
yes travis wouldn't be fooled by someone as ugly as him
friends a selfie
my girlfriend says stop the drama
what
i mean talia and emma are completely useless
what is his problem  
he doesn't want to tease grace
so let's move him
kennedy fire grace
i don't have his number
i don't have anyone's number
at this late stage who are we training for this  
it doesn't matter
i mean he has a problem
i'm chasing a girl
what are we doing
i will not give up
i'll be honest with you travis
i really didn't think you were okay
but you do really well in this role
thanks but that's a good thing
i mean i have two or three exams
between practices and plays
my symptoms are lessening
i have to fix this
we have to give this up
i mean we can't put anyone else
knows very well about this character
only gary
that's a good idea
gary can be mary
it would be a tribute to elizabethan culture
a man playing a female role
god look at the unexpected help
from kennedy
they grow up fast
wait but people
don't get me wrong but i feel it
they usually don't like it
seems a bit controversial here
that's why people will come to see it
if that's hard for you i won't
i mean that solves my problem
christine doesn't think so
am i cheating on him with you  
 okay  okay
ok
the music club is over travis practice
sorry dad i'm coming
coming now
quick let's go
let's go
ok who comes bowling  
sounds like fun but i can't
kennedy what do you say  
i i
i don't know the game of bowling
i will teach that's great
ok
ok i don't wear these ridiculous bowling shoes
ok come on let's all put
these freaking bowling shoes
a part of society for kennedy
he deserves it
hey mr kelvin
great show last night
did you come to my concert
yes yes it's great fun
 thank you for taking me home  ah well
 okay i dropped you off at home    definitely
looks like you had a crazy night
phones stolen from the lobby and returned  
yes crazy

i have to admit i had a hard time
mislead him enough
i really need help from above
hi friend
looks beautiful

good
how was your exam
 i did well  really  
 you have a gift  is it  
 that's great  uhhuh
ok chocolate cake i know you love it

 the goods were to be delivered today  ah
hey is that stupid boy coming to study with you again  
 he's not stupid  ok ok
i don't care
it's not like i'm in love with him
trying to find out about him
 horner michael is here  okay thank you
 hi  hi
 what    nothing
ok there are few days left for the term exam
we better get to work
ok definitely
let's get to work
something is wrong
no problem
are you sure
yes
yes
i'm waiting
creating myself
now i have to create myself
like someone making up a story
i have to present something made up
not true
it's on both sides
did you follow me home
i wanted to know what you were hiding
i don't like to tell people this
i can keep secrets
i live in an orphanage
that is my mother my foster mother
 i'm sorry  do not do not
don't worry about it actually he is the best
unfortunately he really can't stand it
sending me to university
so we better get back to work
because i need a scholarship
a way to pay school fees
then i don't want to come back to this shit hole
ok if you come back you're stuck
you will be ugly and forgotten like this city
yes you got it
i understand
tock tock
i brought hot chocolate and polish babka (polish babka = a type of bread with grapes)
it's like jewish chocolate bread
sounds delicious ms rose
how's it going
other work is not like that i think
mom we are studying
ok
ok
other work is not possible
mary your life is in danger
i want you away from england
oh philip honey can't you see  
this is me
i will not let them take my life's work
i worked very hard for a long time
what is happening to us  
the world is not ready to accept our love
gary is a good actor
ok let's take five minutes
ok
it's really cool
travis needs to improve his speaking style
i think a lot of people will see that
live broadcast will have a large audience
live broadcast  
after we cast gary as mary
i spoke to several lgbtq+ organizations (lgbtq+ = lgbtq+ organizations)
that one organization was willing to provide the necessary equipment
with a website space
about 10000 people come to them every day
my goodness
my goodness
hey kennedy
i like the top flowers
flowers everywhere
mr calvin told you to
he wants to meet you at the office
thank you
hey
i heard him say he was looking for him
i willingly said that i will come and tell
do you know what it's about  
he didn't say
but it seems very serious
ok
 love  really
horner can i have a word  
ok could
hmm
it's a beautiful performance
yes it's really fun really
i am
is something wrong
no not really
i just
everything is fine between you and christine isn't it  
yes not that's fine we are fine
everything is fine do you know
we do erotic things do you know
do you have a problem with drama  
no no no no
not the play is really like
really the best thing in my life
i feel it's hard to pay attention now
for nothing else
it will make your symptoms worse
ah i don't care
as in the play
not within the play but around the play
i feel like i finally got to be me
for the first time in my life
that's strange
it seems like a good thing
yes not that's how it is
that's a good thing definitely a good thing
i do not think
my father would like it more
why
i don't think he likes me to be me
travis i
there you are hamilton
i don't want to have lunch without you
so what were you two doing holding hands  
like a couple  
uh i just helped travis practice a part of the play
he helped me with a drama scene
in the drama
i think you should go with your instincts travis
so far it has worked well
thank you
really thanks for your help
i mean this is the only b i got
you know it's
when this drama is over i know i will
grab these
it doesn't matter
you have done no great harm
hey
hey kennedy hey mr calvin
hey horner
this is kennedy you can listen to the lessons
this is from horner
he knows how to do many things at once
ok remember what i told you both
we will not forget
what does that mean  
my teachers told him that they were worried about me
my symptoms have really subsided so he called my parents
i'm sorry kennedy
i feel like this is my mistake

you have changed my marriage
michael  
hey

someone of value  
i want to get out of here so i play ugly

i mean all of you
travis biggins kennedy park you're all down
the work of the upper classes i think
whatever it is that's why it's my fourth choice
dipniki came up from you
but luckily for you
i don't make my final decision based on symptoms
you you came to my show too
that's a big deal for me
really horner you mean a lot to me
don't worry about the age difference okay  
you are too old
even though you're 17 out there
you're like 30 inside
 mr calvin  yes
are you telling me to sleep with you  
this is i don't know the two of us
will you sleep more  
ah it's so confusing
see i'm still 17 out there
so i need sleep
because i am a child
bye mr calvin
friends stop fighting
 hi  hi
is michael there  
michael  
michael dypnicki
not where his mother works
ah
can you tell me where it is  
hi michael
hey
come in
ah hello
mom this is horner
ah nice to meet you horner
i have heard a lot about you
thank you
can you stay for dinner
can't i want to go home
i hope you can make the time some other day
i don't understand
you came in front of me that day on my way home
so i made a story about this house
i thought it was because of things like sneaking in
make me beautiful and naughty
girls love them
hey kids do you want something to eat  
no thanks sally
you wanted me to follow you home
that's why you said you can't study at home
you wanted to send me to his house
i saw talia and emma follow me home
so i led them there
but i avoided them because i wanted you too
let yourself see
hmm this is why i didn't drag you in with me
i barely had time to turn this around
i made you stay
girls love it too
they usually have a gazillion cans of soda in the fridge
also the pictures i threw all over the kitchen
i was in them
but you were watching me dance madly
michael
also thank you for not giving me pills
of course if you put it in cocoa
i'm actually acting like it was accidentally dropped
on your bed
i think you saved a lot of money
the handmaid's tale
you had it
it is not related to our classes
so i thought it was important to you
doctor who is real though
yes i like doctor who
i don't understand how you knew
that i will do what i did to you
after seeing what you did to kennedy and travis
what
you had many methods to use
put them down but you chose
the way you show your heart
you could have destroyed them right away
when travis found out he was gay
when kennedy is your friend
i didn't want mr calvin to know that i
calvin doesn't care he loves you
not you did that because you care about them
i wanted you to think about me
i i thought about you
i know
so you continued acting
be like a worm  
i'm a bug
that doesn't mean i'm a good person
look a girl like you doesn't fit
you can act like everyone else
someone like me doesn't fit in
this is it i'm not that handsome
don't even say anything about it
dislikes sports
everyone at that school was either avoiding me or abusing me
so i stopped liking them
and what about me  
i want to go to harvard
 hey  hey
do you need help
yes
taking a dough  
so what's going on with that boy michael  
we're screwed
it is good
i mean there's something wrong with him
something fake
why are you laughing  
if you had told me that before
i kept interrupting your lessons
that you will understand
i'm sorry honey
come on
it doesn't matter
don't let that thief get you down huh  
it is in the book the handmaid's tale
yes i gave it to you
you don't thank me for anything

#goodgoodgood
great
great great
great
great great
great
my days are over
leave me with a broken heart
i loved from the beginning
am i a fool dear  
men don't have to choose between power and love
why should women do that  
i learned that there is a reason to like this
i thought i was bloody mary
no one knows who i really am
also nothing stands in my way of success
i wanted to get away from this city but really
i tried to run away only from myself
i didn't want to show people who i really was
because i didn't want to get hurt
but it happened
i was hurt
but i found people of value
if we love them they will love us
who am i now  
haven't decided yet but i'm fine
horner
we are in a little discussion right now
ah this won't take long
hi michael
did he send your recommendation to harvard  
 i  no no no not yet
good
because i think you will think again
mr calvin
are you asking to sleep with me  
why i don't know
will there be time to sleep  
it's not what it sounds like
really  
horner you know you always are
my first choice  
ah
thanks but i don't need your recommendation
it was at harvard that everything went to kennedy
therefore you should recommend our kennedy
ahha ok
bye michael
like i said i'm fine
 hi mom  this is an alarm
how did this happen  
meow meow meow
ok
it's an art no dialogue
only bowling
dead puppies
see as kenny rogers said
you don't remember
the emergency team called the home
not from the st louis radisson guys
where did these children go  
my goodness
once virginity is lost second time
do you want to continue  
that was the loudest clap i've ever heard
the music association is over
you
you smell like roasted potatoes that's a compliment
i told you
if it's drop it don't spill it
ok
give up
he had
we are scared
let's do it again
my goodness

love you guys
really
that's when i knew that he was not the one

# from shazamfuryofthegods2023websrt
the sources read several adventurers
standing above the tumult and fog
what kind of weapons would they use  
they have been brought to our exhibition so far
the rod of god
in horner's stories
the rod is the gift of god
ah welcome soldiers
what did i say
museums are fun places
amusement parks are for brains
 wow  okay
there is no reason to worry
everyone gets a chance to see this
cut the carvings from the aratua
not seen in 2000 years
the two parts of this ancient replica
recently found in many places
at a waste management facility in philadelphia
these are reportedly very strong
three machines were destroyed
ok friends that's enough
i am the star of this episode
stop
stop sir
sir
hey
hey what are you doing  
create a panic
create a panic
create a panic
wait wait let's go let's go
no no no
help
do not
ladies please let me go
my god wait
apparently museums are fun too
let's have more fun
we can't do anything until the workers surrender
we don't have enough champions in this kingdom
human champions are humans
we are gods
do not underestimate the word of a wizard
to protect god's power
he will make a wise choice
strongest most passionate and intelligent champions
this kingdom has ever seen
i'm a fool
i don't deserve power to be honest
like what am i doing  
there is already a superhero wearing a red suit
it has a lightning drawn on it
i'm fast but he's faster
aquaman is big on the one hand he's more of a maneater
and batman is awesome
i'm just me
and i can't tell this to anyone else
because my family looks up to me as a leader
but i feel it
it's a scam
do you understand that i
pediatrician
right  
i mean you were recommended
another patient billy batson
it doesn't matter
can you help me make up my mind
you know stop  
ok see
again a pediatrician not a psychiatrist
but as i see it
you have impostor syndrome
usually it is caused by a tragedy earlier in life
so if you don't mind asking
how well do you remember your childhood  
i remember it like today
a tragedy   i do not know
i mean i've never met my father
my mother left me at a christmas carnival
i spent most of my time in orphanages
escaped from 11 houses
got into a lot of fights
then a wizard kidnapped me
gave me superpowers
then he died right in front of my face
it's not a little
a doctor who bound the seven demons
my family was held hostage
so we had to trap his eyes
then everyone got super powers
but now everyone is doing their own thing
i am the only one trying to bring everyone together
ok ok let's see about it
right   rejected by your parents
it happened with the society
now from the city you are trying to protect
i did not say that i was rejected by my city
rejected by the city
it was the tribune nobody reads it
 i am reading  anyway ok
i appreciate your help but i have some real questions
there is a terrorist hostage situation
 a hostage situation    yes
the hostages died
i am very weak at this
why are we always playing war  
hey it's training for our other job
really said
military tactics a few teammates
everyone has different abilities
nannadunana is released against an enemy
i know about it
but the house is often struck by lightning leo
i tell you
also you're the one always talking about groups
but we don't need guns
darla  
that's right great work
 we are the guns  darla
why are these little toys in my pocket  
it should have been a surprise
that's how it is
hmm he's been different lately
why do you think i pocketed them  
 ah  woohoo ole
this is an army of unicorns
 killing jenhis kahn    yes (a mongol emperor)
unicorns are not real
it's called fictional history eugene
billy you can't go like that
your people are dying
woohoo
 did you see    yes
i said you would like it
if given a chance
yes i'm looking for a way to get it back
what's up  
man what are you doing  
1099 an event occurs (a time when all the police come)
several collisions are reported on the road
the cables hanging the bridge break
all groups come to the ben franklin bridge
yes that's crazy music freddie
it's like that isn't it   listen to an urgent song
we'd better watch it live
i thought the same
i hope we can get tickets
two maybe six
not everyone that is the law
but i'm still going backwards
so now is your last chance
billy batson come with me
no no no no

wonder woman has no job
 stop  not really
you think he wears a ponytail and glasses
like without anyone knowing him

stop you're holding on too tight
that freddy wanted to fly alone for ten minutes
it does not mean that he will leave you like his mother
or i want to go to college
i am not abandoning the family
ok good
about college again i understand
yes
can't you really see yourself  
18 years in five months
they won't let me out they didn't kick you out

really  
victor and rosa are struggling to pay the rent

soon they will stop sending money to you too
i don't care if wonder woman has a job
i want to contribute

like everyone else on earth we have to find a job…
i have to leave home
nothing is eternal
i mean this is called the rock of eternity

ah but we came with gifts
illusions

this kingdom has disillusioned
yes after you destroyed our father's womb
of every god in this kingdom
from me
don't you remember what you took  
what are my powers  
power of the elements
not i have erected a barrier to your race
to not be able to come to the human world
the only way to remove that barrier is
what if someone breaks this  
how
where is the champion  
it was with your hands that this staff was taken from our father and broken
now you make it yourself
i told you i would die before i could help
now say the word
never never

look look look
i know it sounds crazy
besides i don't really know
what exactly does this mean  
but he is very angry
and the noise is trying to warn us i think
he screams about all this
about things like a wizard an empire
do you want to read so loudly  
that's mary because this is not so loud
i think this is the perfect amount of inner voice
what the hell   are you ok
 yes  why are you wearing sunglasses  
did you see the eye doctor this morning  
i don't know i think mary went to the eye doctor
but last night he had a good time

did you meet your friends at the eye doctor  
not he is
yes shall we get back on topic  
listen he's yelling at me
and he speaks of the daughters of atlas

like i don't know how these things change so much
that those doors and rooms or that violin

apparently all of this
a powerful weapon is around
so atlas dad
of the daughters of atlas surely
he fashioned a short staff from the wood of the tree of life
he used that staff to obtain the power of various gods
and take away the power of others
so atlas put all his superpowers in a scepter
they are exactly right it's like a magic battery
but when things go bad
the council of human wizards assembled
this wand was stolen from atlas
it was used to remove his power
after they took the power of atlas the other gods went after…
friends this wizard i know him
this is the wizard i told you about
what does this mean  
the wisdom of a wise man
the strength of hercules the might of atlas
the might of zeus the courage of archyllis
mercury's speed these are the powers they stole
not
wow friends look
this is the meaning of the word
better than i thought
it's not just a trashy word
if you don't mind my pointing out one force is missing here
boop
the wisdom of a wise man
i'm very sorry
you are trying to say delicately
the wisdom that i somehow lack
 of a lonely person    yes
maybe it will happen later
i mean you usually ask mary what to do
 i'm just saying  yes
this hurts a lot
i just want to tell you that
and this one says of a wise man
ah
what else did we learn  
after receiving the powers of god for that staff
the magician has apparently built a kingdom of god
inside a magic sphere
sealing it forever
illusions stopped
ah that's it then
yes i don't think they have stopped now
a strange and terrible thing was revealed
in athens greece this morning
two women dressed in ancient greek dress
wow wow wow that magic wand how did they find it  
all these statues were people before
i wonder how the wand got to europe
until greece  
hey mr maya sorry i took your hammer
do you want it back  
i mean i tore it in half and threw it away
so that should be the start of the journey
 do you know    what  
what do you mean   what  
 did you leave it there    we were all there
friends i had the rod you guys are super powerful
a trifle whatever
then i had to break it or sivana
it does a super bad job right  
you broke the wand
that means you broke the barrier between worlds
we know that now
we still know what they look like
when they come to mourn us we see them both
 coming  three
what
atlas had three daughters
calypso hespera
anthea
annthea
you know i'm not just a superhero
i am a great listener
also
i feel
you have feelings for freddie
i want to know when he will come back
don't bother him
this is anne i mean we can't choose
the people we love
what
i'm not talking about that
if he comes here now he will be in big trouble
wow look who you're with
what could be dangerous  
we
ok
i can see how it works
let's dance
my goodness
freddie  
come on
ah freddie i didn't know
i never meant to bother you
i'm not going to get in trouble
sasham
shazam
sasham

mr g

wait no no no
i forgot how easy it is to explode
why did you do that
like grapes
what huh  
now child tell us where the others are
not required
cut off his branches anthea
come on
wait
there are others
 great let's take them all  do not
that's not what we came here for
we came to find the seeds of life stop it sister
let's go according to our plan
father never surrenders
father is dead now
now know your place sister
or i'll show it
let's do it our way not theirs
if you have one step
i will break this child's neck
ah freddy
billy don't
billy back off
they take our power with a stick
what what
sorry
i'm very sorry
i'm sorry save yourself
no no not everyone we are together
that's okay because you can't go
let's see how you will live in a dying world
do not
do not
freddy
from the city limits on the northern side
to the west coast
even up to cobbs dam
an unidentified obstacle has appeared
a spherical one
no one can enter or leave the city
some call this a magic object
that philadelphia may or may not be the work of the liars
 god  shh
i'm about to sleep
the only way to escape from this torment
ok the cold
just wait
hagrid's beard batman's voice
you are the magician my goodness
you're back billy said everything about you
billy   do you know billy batson  
billy batson yes he is my best friend
i'm i'm freddie freeman captain with all power
it was like that before now it's messed up
he it's complicated
did that stupid billy give you the power of shazam  
yes he said he turned you to ashes but apparently not  
when i gave him power
i could no longer remain in my state
but death becomes a comfortable thing
with being stuck in a cage like this
knowing about my failure and with you
mostly with you
anumpa is a bit more than billy
but everything is fine
 let's get out of here  let's get out of here
yes ok
i didn't mean it that way but that's okay
here's what we have
an absurd wizard with a scornful mind
a precocious young boy with memories like an encyclopedia of illusions
we can't let these sisters trap us for too long
the bars of this prison have been bound by magic
 what spells do you know    please stop talking
if you take a mystical influence  
at least i don't know what it is
okay so let's make a drink
like a giant energy drink or a crushing one
ah another gas
ok maybe we can get out of here like air
i have given my powers to wasted children
we die here free bye
the name is freddie free buy   where are you from  
once you accept that
it will be easy
is this a tooth   there's a tooth here
hmm
the power of the elements the power of chaos
power of axles
these are basic powers
i don't know how we can fight such forces
i'll tell you how
use wisdom
 of the wise  absolutely right
let's call a meeting
let's tell them we'd like an exchange
let's present our powers instead of freddy
but then we caught one of them
let's actually use it instead
but what if they steal our powers  
no they can't because we know how they work
you know what i'm saying   if they point their wands at us they bow down
just like hitting a ball
 hmm  i can't see hitting balls
okay maybe pedro is too weak for that
but not superhero pedro
no so is superhero pedro
ok listen i know there are five of us here and three of them
so i think we should send them a little invitation
ok
so steve is on this paper
one with magic power
when you write a message on the magic leaf
when you say the name of god you want to speak
the leaf bends
oh my god great
into a green bird
then it flies to god
it's great in a way
hey how about the deities   like wonder woman  
do you think he will accept a bird letter  
the pen made me laugh didn't it  
hey steve i just ordered
i did ok great throw it away
ok
letter
letter write a letter no no no
i just spoke loudly
it is not part of the letter throw that away too
maybe if you try
 speak from the heart  hmm
dear daughter of atlas
violence is not the answer
child
i'll spare your life if i'm being honest
sincerely
yes wow there is a good selection
other champions
are they kids like you  
what is a child really  
i mean i know i shave almost every week
are they not  
not your answer is no because nobody is stupid
give a lot of children godlike power
 say their names  the names of the champions  
ah there's brett breyer brooke breyer
do you accept these  
don't write these down   not  
they drive a dodge ram (a cab)
he is lying
that's your superpower not mine
he thinks you're a complete control freak
one of you
maybe you
catch him
no what's going on  
what is this   what does he do
the power of confusion
it gets into one's mind and completely confuses
ah my mind is already crazy
so i'd really like to see you do it
because no one has the strength
bear what's inside my brain
say their names
say their names
say their names
well done destiny's child
he is stronger than he looks
 say their names  stop
billy
billy bat
billy ba
stop
this is sent by champions
dear daughters of atlas
violence is not the answer
ah a good first sentence thanks darla
 we would like to make an exchange  what  
we give our powers
if you give us freddy say 'safe' too
otherwise they will exploit with monkey hands
great eugene
steve put 'safe' as well
and then like yours truly…
not honesty is good
maybe just sign 'champions'
shouldn't we find fault with this  
not steve doesn't make mistakes
just writing what you say
great i feel this is good me too
who needs a gatorade   (an energy drink)
do we have red  
what is gatorade  
 is that a weapon    sister
we don't want to bother him anymore heard the letter
 drag it to them  wait
they want to make an exchange
we will meet them sister
but people cannot be trusted
vala is a bad name for a fun place isn't it  
right  
are you hurt
not it just doesn't seem to work
 you should get up  why  
all these performances to become a superhero
an act to show that i am not broken
feelings
 i saw something moving  i saw that too
shik
what is that  
leyden
the gardener who guards the garden of atlas
 run  i can't i can't
you are fine you guys are fine
i don't feel well
that is the power of the dragon
fear radiates from every pore of his body
creatures are paralyzed by leyden's fear
therefore no one can enter the garden he guards
power of axles great a lot
 very rare  anthea
i have to go
the door to your world is in the middle of the maze
right left left
then go along the wall on the right side until you reach the middle
 you'll need this  where did you find this  
you saved me once
in your world freddie freeman
now i save you in my world
the hero
to be honest i didn't really need your protection
i made it for those guys
transplant organs if you didn't intervene
but you didn't know that so you are brave
i was brave because i had superpowers
no you are the most powerful thing
how lovely you two are
goddess we thank you but we now…
you guys go my sisters don't need you anymore
all they want now is the seeds
 the seed    yes
it is hidden in an inaccessible place
to anyone of their race come on jeff soon
do you call me jeff he said my whole name
hi god no  
yo people
when will you solve this globe problem  
no no no no don't worry sir
i have a plan
 really    uhhuh
because it looks like you're eating a sandwich
no is this a sandwich  
no this sandwich is for important work
these are for a meeting
yes ok cheese meat colonel
colonel  
come on i need a good name
a silent person
i find the most effective way is to cut the enemy's throat
it
you really mean it ok
ah
ok see this is the case you're in trouble
some wizards came and stole your powers
it's really sweet i understand
but i feel you all
taking it so personally i don't even know you do i  
if thieves clean your house at night
if they steal your money and run away
you usually chase don't you  
then think the thieves in this jump
the money was left on the floor
a neighbor of yours picked it up and kept it
now imagine it's not money
but your father's life blood
your mother's last breath
powers of all gods
all the magic of the empire has been stolen
now these illusions come through you
there is anger towards you
why do you think it suits you  
this is very personal
billy
you are very threatening
i want to tell you that like i really…
i see your progress it goes a long way
but today i really want to talk about compromises
there is no consensus
i knew you were saying that
the wisdom of saruman don't bump into me okay  
give us freddy you get rid of this
something like a spherical magic pot
and then you know
we don't have to destroy you
that's a good suggestion
i mean really
you act like an adult
but you don't do it well
give us the power back baby
all of them
you're not a leader billy
you are a lost boy
he wants to believe that he is a war hero
ok i may be as inexperienced as you
because i'm not super old like you
but i think i have some experiences that you don't
because i have seen all the fast and the furious movies
let me tell you something
it's all about family
family
friends that is the signal we practiced this about a dozen times thank you
forgot about my whole family didn't you goddess  
no man you forgot my people
come on
 let's go  pedro
you're wasting my time guys
yes
woohoo
he definitely didn't see it
because he didn't go to the eye doctor
darla it's
a lovely name
not
we took power from two
your family already
now two more people die why  
are you going to continue acting like a soldier  
my father is atlas
a titan is a god of power and strength
his spells and powers are within you
but you will never be a true god
really   did your father have super speed  
not
are you ok it's fun let's go
like like like
quick everyone
let's go let's go
what  
you thought you were going in
a normal portable toilet right  
but i still smell it
yes yes it really stinks around that's crazy isn't it  
 yes  like spreading
of gas it doesn't matter however
accepted to the rock of eternity
only for champions
it can come in through any door we like
there is little we can do your sister can't
friends this is what i call total success
okay maybe a partial total win
 i told you that i am weak at playing  yes
you said but you know
pedro we all have weaknesses
you know what i'm saying  
his
lack of strategic thinking
now to the actual exchange
freddy and the wand for your freedom
remove another sphere
yes
remove the sphere
because inside the city
the temperature increases
good words man
yes i'm sad
as soon as they came out of my mouth
it's one of those words
i know i just
dear latasse's daughters
burn
i just made it up and said
don't forget to put a line in the middle of it
then it's clear ok
steve looking at grammar is great
about more letters it makes me smarter
so
a brother for a sister huh  
how does that feel  
also how did you actually become sisters  
because the age gap is very visible
it's a little confusing i'm not gonna lie
even though i don't like you much
i believe everyone has human rights
but you will not be given strawberries
you only get yellow
he's gone
wait what  
i thought we caught him too easily
he wanted to be caught
i don't understand where has he gone  
this looks like a must
yes we are lost thank you
we are not lost who is the wizard here  
i don't know
you have no spells no magical objects
you don't know anything about magic you just
you are the magician
 thank you  anything
now let's see if you can trust your girlfriend
back off back off back off
ok i think the way is clear let's go home
just wait
didn't you see what he had in his hand  
it's an apple he wants food
what do you think so much  
the golden apple from the tree of life
from the tree of life
oh wait you said it was careful somewhere didn't you  
 billy  billy my goodness
where are you going now
not
he is not here
not
no no no that's not the way to go
 it's a hard road  billy
don't worry about it
it's just a maze going nowhere
just like in ancient greek
 a maze    friends
that smell
hmm
hespera
it's over sister
now let's plant this seed and build our kingdom
or we plant this in their kingdom
but it destroys their world
they seem to have destroyed ours
do you really mean it  
 yes  not
no we did not agree to that
anthea you are a childish bully
he was right we spent years
until this time
we have seeds
we have wands with powers
we should not waste them
for your personal pleasure
no i'll go not you
i know what you're thinking
how a child on crutches becomes a silent thief
but here's the deal your knees make a lot of noise when you walk
that's the end
did you see
good luck to you freddie
thank you what did you tell me  
freddie freddie freeman
that's right you said it perfectly
see you on the other side
even if we do the tree of life
nothing will grow in their soil
it makes you confused and confused about something
to something dangerous  
that's what people call it
it is fitting that we take our demons to their world
if we do what they did to us
we agreed on the balance
a heavy weight has been placed on revenge on that scale
anthia men are enemies even to themselves
 not not everyone  everyone
sister i fear your vengeance will destroy you
why  
people kill loot
then pray to god to set him free
they really pray for law and order
but they do stockpiles all the time
anthea i want you to get the apple
plant in our garden
you will definitely be him
dad will be ashamed of both of you
where did it get here  
 hi  you're on his side hespera
did you see how we were betrayed  
give him the fate he deserves sister
 do not  kill him
what is that  
good question no idea
but you had to look
billy
 ah  ah
your crutch
ah shazam
 ok  do not
we have a lot to talk about
calypso give me the staff
you are not fit to use it
you deserve better
you held him in your arms but did nothing
our only aim is to avenge our father
but all of them are weak
leyden the worldeater
get up from the hole
let's go let's go
captain where is he going
what
victor  
victor get up
hello god what  
dad we have to go
 we have to escape from here  we have to go now
isn't this a joke   i know how this looks
that's not true i have no idea how this looks
don't worry
i mean don't worry look at me i'm billy
rosa this is billy right   this is eugene
 this is freddy  this is me
this is darla this is mary obvi

but yes that's us are you in a hurry now  
we have to go the dragon is here
the dragon

ok
i know this is too much to accept
but i promise to explain later
describe what  
our children are superheroes greek gods after them
did a dragon destroy the house we recently bought  
 yes  wait did you go home  
yes
run let's go
come on

mary

ok
now where is the dragon  
a place called a park
wow wow wow
let's go let's go let's go
god i'm slipping slipping
my shoes
my goodness
you know i never thought i'd say that about a dragon
but that is the least of our problems now
your world will not survive this
yes marilyn
he's right
ann
 are you okay   are you hurt  i'm fine well
in god's kingdom this tree
a beautiful one
peaceful
it is not suitable for the soil of this kingdom
and depending on the hand that planted it it becomes a demon
whose side are you on   you
i should try naming hespera
only he can control our sister
i give my all or die trying
die   do not i'm pretty sure
we can do something without dying
my dear freddie i am ready for it if need be
i have lived a long life
what are you reading about long life  
we are the same age you are young we are young
i am over 6000 years old
eh  
you are beautifull
ah
suddenly it doesn't seem right
yes
we can't let him die he called me honey
we have to do something
take back my power
 no billy  no no no
hey take my powers back
you gave them to me can you take them back  
i'm not a champion anymore it's you
do you think i know what to do with this  
but i really don't know right  
i didn't even know about greek sisters
i googled about them but you know them
it means knowing what to do
you are right
you picked the wrong champion
i mean that's why i always say everyone doesn't
because without my family i can't do anything
honestly i have no idea what to do
not
you don't even have a bar of wisdom
inside your brain
but your heart is smart
it knows exactly what to do
i spent centuries searching for a worthy champion
no one deserves what i shared
with my brothers and sisters
but when you share your power
you didn't hesitate
you deserve everyone
if you get a chance
now fight for your family
fight for the world
i chose the right person
billy  
billy what are you going to do  
what we always do freddie save the world
now i take the rod
i want these animals removed
on the arena side until i fight the dragon okay  
wait wait wait billy billy
can i see you before you go
not like this
you you
my sacrifice
shazam
is this why the house was often struck by lightning  
hey
i promise after this
if i hadn't been eaten by a dragon
i don't force you to keep me
 right    what  
i know i'm getting old soon
billy
my wonderful kind brave son
you never get old in my house
never
now do me a favor
i say this from the bottom of my heart
kick their ass right  
i love you mom
me too
shazam
it will take time to get used to
all to the war wagon
the war wagon  
trying to get the feeling of this incident
don't you see what you are doing to these people  
i can see
i do what i see
hespera look at this tree
it's like a fungus it's unnatural here
we made a promise to restore our kingdom
not to destroy another one
god finally heard their prayers
they don't know their place
so i show it to them
your crazy voice sounds like our uncle hades
not i will finish this
hespera
do not
hespera
if your feelings are with people anne
it's okay if you're a man too
help somebody
someone help
someone help
ok what now there are many animals here
i almost couldn't finish being hit by a car
hey steve
what are demons afraid of  
to the king of demons
the lions  
unicorn
really   i love unicorns
but unicorns don't love you
friends there is no such thing as a unicorn
what
 ah  ah
i don't think so crazy
unicorn is the most dangerous animal in that kingdom
merciless merciless
not like the ponies in your story books
they hate mercy
are there things they like  
dark caves elixir  
the elixir it's like a soft drink for god
it should be sweet like honey
i have an idea
let's go quickly
friends these people can be moved to a slightly safer place
children  
 let's go  come on let's go
the wizard

freddie  
ann  
ann

maya fire
illusions are killed by illusions
yes yes yes illusions kill illusions

i know it because i've never seen it
my dress is on fire like this
besides no one plays with my city
you know what i'm saying

most of the power is yours
it's you
you taught me that
kill them
boom
as a dragon that would be a big regret
i think you are one
i mean when you fly you breathe fire
but you're made of wood it's strange
a big design flaw to be honest
freddy anthea no

auntie
have you decided what to do  
to your god empire  
i'm actually giving it some time to heal
spend some time with ordinary people
learn about your world
how can we know about each other  
the first sign of wisdom:
understanding that there is more to learn
i do it
i will see
wow
ah friend  
friends
this wizard
 my goodness  can't be
 yes  look at him
look at him his handsomeness
what is this  
 you look great  you're awesome
as soon as i came here
i wanted to come and say
before my honor goes
sorry the doorbell is broken everything is really broken
not everything
as soon as you come right  
ok i came to get the staff
maybe i'll keep this one for now
i wanted to see your faces one more time
before i turn into a pile of ashes again
 what    do not
i was joking i brought an uber
also
i was stuck in the rocks and cages for a long time
now it's time for me to see the world
it's an honor for me
it's a privilege you guys to step up
you know you're not such a bad wizard
thanks jeff
it won't end
also
what is my superhero name  
your name
shazam
 definitely  yes
i think it can be beat
there is more part of the movie so stay tuned
translated and subtitled by nilusha hemal alahakon
my leg hurts how much further  
ten seconds less
than last time i was asked
i'm sorry i think we had
stop the car a little closer
he doesn't know we are coming
i don't want to scare him
be afraid he is a superhero not a deer
ok let's go
then you tell waller
although he thought this person was a good addition
we never really met him
because of your kehelmal shoes
ok originally they were boots
they are not snails they are new
 i haven't had a chance to season them yet  shut up
waller said this guy was pretty powerful
but a little young
great
woohoo
 billy batson  yes  
i mean no
i have never heard that name in my life
i don't know who you are talking to
but i would like to meet him
because he looks awesome and funny
more clever and very handsome
but that's awful
what the hell are you reading about  
calm down we know who you are
 how    don't worry about it
who are you
don't worry about that either
we've seen what you can do
we are here to give you a suggestion
would you like to join  
 justice  yes
a thousand times yes
my goodness i was dreaming about this
i mean not exactly
usually it's with wonder woman
dreamed but
 yeah  huh  
it was easy
accepting the justice society
ok what
the justice society  
is it different than justice league  
yes justice society
different from justice league
because words are different
i want to join the wonder woman team
 so it's you isn't it    not
why do you like wonder woman so much  
is he kidding  
 not    okay i leave
i'm here for a while because of my shoes
can you come here and get me  
hey just a little review
it's very confusing isn't it  
two different superhero teams
unrelated in any way
but when both have justice in their names
have you thought about changing the name and starting over  
because if you just search on thesauruscom
you have many choices
like authority club eh  
the law society that's stupid
they are like legal sentences
avenger society
i like it for some reason
ha ha doctor we met again
what the hell were you doing  
make a good plan doctor
one with patience
what are you talking about
it's been two years now
yes but time is a trick of the mind isn't it  
an optional measure
hey i'm 57 years old
i'm stuck in a concrete box with lunatics
until a worm comes something
make a plan i know nothing  
it takes me a long time to get somewhere right  
i have no legs i have no wings
i keep crawling
but not for long
tell me everything
i have one more thing to do
what   do not
come on kehelmala

# from vesper2022websrt
the new dark ages
the human community tried to stop the impending environmental destruction by investing heavily in genetic engineering
it failed
manmade viruses and organisms escaped they destroyed a lot of edible trees animals and people
an aristocracy emerged within the encircled cities called citadels everyone else struggled to survive
for food there is the harvest of seeds brought from citadel however they are designed for one harvest only
ah it's hot
why the rush  
i'm going to the old lab
ah i don't like it here
looking over there
look what i found
enough vespers my battery is dead
who asked you to come  
you should have stayed home and recharged
you are wasting our time with this research
don't worry
it doesn't hurt
thank you
stay here
he was a pilgrim come on
 i think she's a woman  give up
one day i'd like to go after one
look where they take this garbage
do not they do it until they die
how do you know they won't come home  
everyone knows that
how does everyone know about these people  
vesper he's not coming back
is there anyone else with you  
i think they are gone
i can't hear anything
vesper tank
power
take the extra one from the fridge
i took it
i wanted space to plant cells
i go to jonas
who is the leader  
who is the leader  
i am
but they haven't hacked
this jug is your responsibility
now put this poor animal out of his misery
this is not a man
he doesn't feel anything
he was made in a laboratory
you paid a lot for that jug what a crime
 why did you come here vesper    you know
how do i know   you are locked in a shed with my brother
someone broke our generator
is it  
what a world
all our bacteria are gone
we don't have electricity
you know we can't do social work
i don't ask for that
trust me we worked on it
the family must stick together to survive this
especially when citadel people increase the number of seeds
fortunately we have what we need
skinny
look who came to see us
your blood doesn't always grow young
it is a crime to waste it in such a hurry
but definitely
living alone like you
you're lucky you didn't mess up more
pilgrims masked people hooligans
they come to your door
the end will be tragic
you are too careful here
what is happening to my father  
we will take care of him
it is not his fault that his mother left
both of you will be comfortable
especially in winter
when i see you i remember my mother
i hope you are not afraid of me  
i don't want to be your child bearer
you talk like it's a bad world
think you are better than others  
i have abilities
i learned them myself
one day i will go out
but you
you will stay here
children's blood is sold and seeds are taken
the girl with my expectations
do you know that we are the same you and me  
because we don't allow this world to trample us right  
but don't think you can change this way
use every opportunity you get
can you take my bacteria  
you come back in two days
i want to sell your blood to citadel
you know dad won't last long without energy
if only i had more
do not
do not
do not do not
if you see what i got you won't be angry with me
what is this   where did you get this  
 jonas gave me  for what  
 what did you have to give him    nothing
i took them
put it back before he finds out
can't
they are mine i unlock them
 plant them  you know it can't be done
if i do citadel will hire me in one of their labs
they will never let you in
like your mother you are afraid that i will go
[man] ah vesper
you don't know the value of dreams
shut up
 you belong here  shut up
i saw a small plane last night
it must have collapsed
do you want to help   is that you  
put him back where you found him
he is not our responsibility
maybe he will help us
come on
do you think he will take us to the citadel  
these people are not kind
what does he get for taking you  
may be
 lab  nothing
are you trying to blow us up  
do you want me to leave him dead  
yes
where is the man who was with me  
you were alone
i want to find him
he was injured when the plane crashed
can you take me to where you found me  
you won't get far
can i help
can you help
you can go
get help find him
we are not your employees
yes sorry for my lack of rituals
it's my father i'm afraid of him
don't go without gifts for your help
we have help
did you call citadel   are they coming
i don't know
i fell out of the plane before it crashed
 father  do not
i can't be stopped
do whatever you want but don't come crying to me
i am camelia
vesper
don't regret helping us
i have my word
let's start in the morning
 insufficient security at night  thank you
i gave you the best ones
thank you
who lives with you  
me and dad
this freaking drone
he uses it to communicate
what happened to him  
he was injured while working
citadel to the army
all they gave was the old crappy drone
if we take you both to citadel
i am sure they will help
really   you
can you do it
hmmm
my father is very powerful
did you hear that dad  
father  
dad dad dad
stop
dad don't
father father father
please don't stop
stop dad
oh dad stop
 please don't  catch him
he is sleeping now
what did he do to you
i don't know
can everyone in citadel do that  
i do not think
luckily he was
he is up now
vesper  
i came looking for pilgrims
this guy needs help
 nice to see you too darius  jonas
i see the power is back
i found the extra battery
how lucky
we still owe your blood
you come and meet us
take me
take me
why didn't anyone come looking for you in the citadel  
camila
close this
lay with me
i suddenly thought
what are you doing with my children's blood  
are you using them to make yourself special  
help
please
are you sad
 now know how it feels  do not
do not do not
do not do not
do not do not
do not let go
do not
do not
no no no
take it off
save the good stuff
what are you worried about  
is this guy important to you  
there was another passenger
how did you find this  
we found out
did you pull it up and fall  
why don't you look at me  
because he is afraid of you
let's go vesper
do not
you can't go like that
without helping to clean this up
we say nothing was found
he can't lie all the time
jonas is looking for him
if he does something out of fear it's dangerous
we must inform the citadel
only jonas has the transmission radio
so  
have you ever sneaked into his farm  
did you find him  
we couldn't find anything
but how
our plane couldn't have crashed that far away
this province is really big
we are leaving tomorrow
we need to inform citadel about this collapse
our neighbor has a radio
let's start it tomorrow morning
yes
ok
let's do it
your leg
you stopped limping
can i see
did you make this  
i made it for him
protect his open wounds but
it did not speed up his recovery
i didn't know people here knew about synthetic biology
pests have brains too
this is not a big deal
 come with me  vesper it's not careful
he must know about my work if i am to be taken to the citadel
let's go
the little ones always congratulate me
he likes you
this is the first one i made
he's bummed because i haven't come in a few days
he's not the prettiest but
he is a character
just like dad
come on
they are careful here but i think one day
they will find a way out
i have never seen anything like this
we have to show these to elias
who
my father
he has an artificial biological brain in the citadel
[whispers] he likes these
i'm still learning
the first ones didn't even live
or they killed each other
but i'm getting there
a perfect combination with every generation
i make mistakes myself
these should be blue like the others
something has changed in my original code
let's find out why you're not doing what you should be doing
we both know i can't go to citadel
but the child trusts you it's a big thing for him
when did your mother disappear  
he is not dead
he left us
pilgrims followed
who are the pilgrims  
they walk in groups
wearing a veil to cover the head looking for old things
no one knows why
they don't talk
why did mom go after them  
dad said he dreamed a lot
it's sad to be here
he
he wrote these beautiful songs
when you sing that it makes you feel…
a warmth
one morning i
i went to him
ask him to sing
his voice is gone
two days later he was gone
some people say
pilgrims happen because of a virus
if he had a choice he wouldn't have left you
how are you
i have never met
maybe that's good
do they really exist  
there was a long time ago
is it true citadel can manufacture…
 any creature    hmm
 have you seen him before    hmmmmm
this is a cat they are very free
could it be true  
yes
 what is this    this is an owl
they can fly
 this one    this is a parrot
they repeat what we say
 what    what  
 what are you doing    what are you doing  
 i understand  i understand
 stop now  stop now
 stop  stop
 stop it stop now  stop it stop now
 stop  stop
 stop it camelia  stop it camelia
 stop it stop  stop it stop
 stop really stop  stop really stop
 stop stop  stop stop
this is a wolf
they go in droves
they like to shout at the moon
why is the citadel closed to people like us  
if they opened the doors to all the available resources would be insufficient
but
you make jags and work
we can do their work
citadel likes to rule
jags are made to be biased
it's not easy with people
whisper something
he must be busy
i will go and see the situation
come in vesper
spinning does not work properly
while i'm making it
why did you two come here  
vesper
why did you sneak into my farm  
we have come to collect what you owe me in my blood
there is no need to sneak up behind it
last time your kids stoned me
things are a bit tense here
a few days ago our planted seeds disappeared
skinny took care of them
he said the insects took them
think  
i had to send him away to think about it
if you can't trust your family
do you really think insects stole these  
stay here
if insects are caught stealing something from my family store
i tear off their wings
with each leg
then what about the other passenger  
did you see anything
i'm tired of liars
this drone is as good as new
but we do not do social work here
are you hungry
can fly
what did he do to you
fly one more time
do not
do not do not
what happened
vesper  
did you join citadel  
vesper
 hey take a moment  no
 vesper  do not
 what if this can't be fixed    definitely possible
you will find a way
i promise
then we can go find elias
because i feel so good
he is dead
show me
no no no
no no no
no no no
you
i am a jug yes
but i've seen jags before
not like you
he made me
i am different
you can't take us to citadel
as we escaped from the citadel it collapsed
making a smart jag is a big crime
they will kill me
elias made a covenant
with another citadel from refugee status
you never tried to take us
be clean go
vesper i'm sorry
i never felt useless
look to fly
you can't stay here
jonas knows about you
he thinks you belong to him
we're not going anywhere dad
he is a jag
he lied to us
you are right
i take him to jonas
then he takes me lightly
don't treat him badly
jags obey their master
he has nothing else to do
stop
i'm not anymore
don't try to give up when things get tough
we all have a hard time
but there we are
we help each other
follow me
sit down
i figured out why this isn't doing what it's supposed to
it has some kind of mold and orange color
together they make something new
if a flower can change its purpose
you can too
what
may i test a sample of yours  
camellia  
camellia  
look at this section
it repeats itself
but it does not belong to your maternal dna
 what is that    it's locked
elias didn't tell me anything
i played for elias while he was working
he said it made it easier to focus
he was in a citadel lab
with their technology it should be easy
you will not like citadel
elias often said life there is like a frozen river
the surface is beautiful
but underneath
everyone wants to live forever
it's a fun lonely life
you lived there
i was there for elias
i entertained him and took care of him
i let him take care of me
i warmed him up
helped him sleep
he did everything he told me
camellia  
not keep going
there the last one keep weaving it
see
these are the dna structures of plants
there are many of these i don't understand
wait
father
i found the secret code of the citadel seeds
i can breed these
we will never be together again
that's his plan:
give that to them to enter the other citadel
you must take vesper there tomorrow
 no  vespers
 father  you
i will not leave you
you don't understand citadel will be brutal
i need new filters i'm going to the old lab
you won't believe what i'm about to do
i'm so glad to finally meet you miss
and you  
where are my customs  
my name is jonas
i am his brother
if you come with me
help me get home
we contacted citadel as they arrived
you are either wrong or
someone is not telling the truth
i am the only person in this province who has a radio
you have to be very careful
who do you believe  
my house is very
suitable for a woman
it is big and very comfortable
it does not even smell of death
i will come with you
can't believe it
you are human
 a jag needs a master  i have someone
not anymore
do you think i'm stupid  
vesper stop
[jonas shouts]
no no no no
no jonas
give up
this is how it ends
i want to come to an agreement
camellia's owner is an engineer
the way he unlocks the seeds is hidden in his dna
i can fertilize them
we will both have food
i found the jag you were looking for
this is mixed with seed cells
it changes their dna
how long will it take  
it worked
this little one can change our lives
stay away from windows
vesper
give up
don't breathe it
[both breathing irregularly]
they will be here soon
i will surrender
it's too late now they know we helped
you and vesper go now
no
 we won't leave you here  don't argue
i can give you time to escape
look at me
[mechanical respiration]
you and camelia go to the citadel to the south
give these seeds and ask for protection
can't i don't want any of this
i will give them seeds
it doesn't happen like that
i will not leave you
vesper
how is this  
let's fool them
you hide in the swamp i'll say you're gone
when it's all over come back
i have worked for them i know how to talk to them
also
how can they harass me more  
we can hide you from them too
that's right
that's a good idea
promise to take care of him
no no no
do not do not
 i'm sorry come on  do not
 come here sorry  no no
no no
he is always with you
he is always with you
vesper
he said go to your garden
once safe proceed to the southern citadel
right  
come on
come on
come on
to run
don't touch the red grass
i will come with you
hey
they won't stop until they catch me
do not
dad said
to be together
you can't leave me
vesper do you remember what you said about the seeds  
how can one change everything  
 do not  vespers
 you can't do this  it's okay
you come with me
you are with me that is all
you have to do what i say
it's a command i command you to stay with me
 vesper  right   come come
you are with me
you want to be with me right  
you want to be with me you won't leave me
no no no
 please  vespers
don't leave me  shh
 oh  vesper
 please  vesper
please
stay with me
have beautiful dreams

a father's duty is to protect the family

i don't know what kind of terrible thing could have happened
to him because of your misfortune
tokyo
i am ready
you get the new and improved me
when i worked with barry
i felt calmer than ever
without ever
like i'm not responding to the occasion
i accept people's shortcomings
i was halfhearted about going back to work
but as barry says:
if we give peace to the world we will also get peace
i think your new doctor forgot

my misfortune is also in the bible
someone dies without me trying to kill people
that's an exaggeration
is it   my last job  
the political threat pictures  
 i voted for you  remember the man who killed himself  
he climbed to the roof of the hotel he was in
i can't do this anymore  
looks like he's more unlucky than you
hang in there friend
he didn't die
right   you took him to the hospital
that's lucky
 it's the way you see it  okay
i like this one
i can live here
i like the environment people care about others
except that guy
why pay so much for this  
this should have been covered
but he has a stomach problem
 carver    you know
he doesn't want to steal and run away
did i come to be a carver  
did you choose me because there was no cover  
you said to make the first task of coming back a simple one
this is very simple
shik
 what is chic    i think my key
falling when that guy crashed
what's the number on this  
523
carver
what arrogance
i mean about an aspirant trying to improve
taking sick leave  
i mean what is this a school  
i hear your personal story
i know read my opinion
i want to fix it
but god what a fool
you had strange requests fireworks  
i am an enthusiast

he said that some conflicts require guns
shik

it's a start
hey this is great
general  
i'm thinking of starting my own place
all simple work every time
it's a solid business plan
no more crazy no more maniacs
only good people
barry said it was time for a change he seems right
barry doesn't know what your job is
ok here now
the bullet train has 16 boxes
ten is normal six first class
remember every stop only lasts a minute
what the hell looking forward to it
what is he does he look blind  
hey hey hey
come on theft   do not
you don't have to steal the biscuits
lemon and tangerine

it's like i was forced
when i see it i want to buy it
someone will have to talk really
goldfish biscuits  
i mean i don't understand
ok a simple steal and escape
what am i stealing or lifting  
a briefcase
the information is in the form of a train sticker
briefcases have owners they are not simple
hmmhmm as for the latest information
the owners are in the middle class
owners plural  
why didn't you tell me to get the gun  
i told you went for spiritual understanding
please

wait
ah this is a receipt
ah
i think my ticket is lost

come on shik
shik damn
who did i kill  
there is something wet

 yes my blood is not coming  then
leave your jacket open
for everyone to see well
yes i want to show everyone my tie
yes yes what the hell is wrong with you
put your coat on before anyone sees lemon
i think they will understand the silly nicknames first
but we remain as fruit
but why not like apples and oranges  
what's in the briefcase  
are we doing this  
you know what's inside
money
always money
tangerines are intelligent
now he calls a fruit smart
yes it is a hybrid with a different fruit
they adapt
like me

two bags per person
let's see it's double it's more
the hell i can't wait for this brief
 wait  what  
 how about a train sticker    yes
my goodness
 why did i become a lemon    because you are careless
 nobody likes lemons  that's nonsense friend
 lemonade lemon drops  does your throat hurt  
 lemon pie  when is the last time  
 did you eat a lemon pie    lemon cake
excuse me are you talking about lemons  
got the briefcase
that's great
 is it    yes
 what is the underlying purpose    there is no such thing
there is always an ulterior motive
get off the train
unlike lemon i don't like nicknames
look at this
sleeping princess
wake up

you are safe now
your father sent us
you idiots does my father work too   ah

have you seen thomas the tank engine  
it started
hey look what's up now
 what is that    nothing
it's confusing violent storyless messageless
 what does it mean    huh  
what should we learn  
everything i learned was about people
learned from thomas
yes you brought the sticker book didn't you  
i always take the stickers with me you know
take this tangerine
he is a gordon this is the blue one
gordon is the strongest most important person
but he doesn't always listen to others

i mean some people are edwards smart and kind
some people are henry working strong
some are diesel

your father took us out of trouble
you are trying to have good or bad boy  
why did you why did you become a tangerine  
that's smart friend
kehelmala
it doesn't matter does it  
what is important is the 17 dead bodies we left behind
coming back saving you from your kidnappers
thinking of asking for ransom
from your psychotic father
it's actually 16 there
what now
 16 people were killed  not 17 there

shik it's not our fault
 it's not our fault  not ours  
what is thomas the tank engine lemon  
it's really ugly
he says hey take responsibility
he is not like that
the distance between me and the owners is going to increase
are you sad
 you are nervous  because i'm sad
listen to this
i get off at the next stop
let's sit down then huh  
do you know what they tell you  
i know
the white killer
 not a fruit  not here
there's a story… if you've heard it stop me…
one woman falls into an unfortunate situation
for owing your father some money
now the question is
it took some time to find that money
but he paid five minutes late isn't it  
yes what did he do their hand was cut
what the hell
he said every minute you need to rub your finger
ah
however he is not a demon
he didn't make her sit down five times
he got cut once didn't he  
come on
this is very easy
you think too much
 you think less  it's not a word
 yes it is  really  
 i think so  did you google it  
it doesn't matter
what would barry say  
from a negative perspective says barry
a negative result is obtained
wow how much do you pay him  
our job is to take care of you
and taking the briefcase with the ransom money
my plan is to finish the job
 lemon  hmm  
where's the briefcase  
i had it in hand
the briefcase is a lemon
go get it for me
hmm do you know you are bound  
to my father
hmm  
he doesn't need a reason to kill people like you
he needs a reason not to do that
does he have one  
this mess gets tangled up
hello  
do you have the son of the white mare  
what you ask is this idiot with a stupid face tattoo  
 yes he is sitting here  and the briefcase  
definitely i have it
both of you get off at kyoto stop
 come on  then your deal
run out
it was here
not here now
we have to find the person who took it
maybe you're right
my luck seems to be turning around
you
yes
i am
but you are yuichi kimura
you came here
kill me
my parents tell me
it means little princess
of course they want a boy
do you want to hear the whole story  
or you are very very sorry
that's from the hospital
wait
hi
yes you can see the boy now
if you don't get a call from me every ten minutes
or if i didn't pick up the phone when you were talking
i want you to go in and kill
excuse me what's the boy's name  
vataru
ok ok
kill the monster
are we better off waiting  
we have his son that is our job
our job is to come back with his son
with his $10 million
there are three words to explain this situation
do you know what they are  
his son was saved
hmm  
family is more important than money right  
you honestly don't know the white maraya do you  
yes i know the white fairy
you said five minutes ago
he cut off his hands and sent
why did i send you operational information  
i don't know
japanese underworld
a man named minegishi ruled
minegishi is a terrible thief
but he is an oldfashioned worker
he only wanted tradition and partisanship
if you're in you're in
you are like family
he treats him like one of his own
then suddenly a sixfoot tall man came
from russia
there were rumors that he was exiled
if not from the russian mafia he is an exmilitary man
no one knew the truth
but what was known is that this russian
his positions were promoted and worked
little by little murder by murder
very very soon
he became minegishi's closest adviser
his supporters said hold your horses
this grandfather is not a good person
don't trust him
he is dangerous
a modern epidemic they said
a white mare
sure they're right
he formed his own alliance
his own team
so what did he do  
anna from behind him
i mean by analogy
his brains were taken out isn't it  
so let me put this bluntly
there is a soulless crazy leader
with the biggest criminal organization on earth
holding us by force
that thief must be a diesel right  
if you talk about thomas again
i'll shoot you right in the face
ok ok if he is such a thief
why did he hire two ordinary people  
without going and taking his son himself  
because if you actually read the information
you know he had a wife
 he had a wife    yes
his wife is the most important thing in his life
he died
a work done by a drunk driver
now he is at home and has not gone out since then
a damaged vehicle will learn a lesson
learn listen he got us
as a normal couple lemmon
no he asked the best two
he asked to take responsibility
two to work in bolivia
he asked the wise men
don't screw up
three words lemon
we are so screwed
what do you want
people think i am a normal girl
someone's future wife
a future mother
but i am not in anyone's story
you are all mine
what does it have to do with me  
you work for the scariest boss in town
white horse
say no if you like
but you work
working for someone else for someone else for another…
in the end it stops at the same person
you brought a briefcase two days ago
to a disciple of the white lion
i saw my chance
if you go after the briefcase you will find the white fairy
i don't know what you think
that is my favorite part of the story
you kill him for me
how do i kill the white fairy  
you will see
look at that
we will be on time
sit down be a little free
you are upset
we saved his son didn't we  
let's find the person who took the briefcase
let's fix everything
 pretend it didn't happen  pretend it didn't happen
looks like you still have the bulletproof vest
alas these covers give a false sense of security
maybe shot in the neck
yes it also stops you getting shot in the chest
but i think i missed the story about thomas
i actually forgot but it was dark
a hunter or a shut up
a slight change in plan
or a
first his wife now his son  
there are many white deaths
26 years ago
you need to be strong son you understand  
ok
be strong
the wolf
my heart
do not
find me the person who did this
lucky bally's son
did you hurt me
you ruined my life
i don't even know you
i came to take revenge

my wife was also killed
but my destiny this turned to take revenge on two
ah

great story bro but
i think you had a different plan
take the briefcase and leave here
 no no  the body is left outside us
thinking that the white mare will be busy
instead of cutting our fingers we will cut our hands
it's like a thomas cartoon
 simplicity is good  children's story  
yes kehelmal children
i learned everything about people from thomas
 everything  really  
that's how i was able to tell about people
you are a diesel haha
i am not a diesel person
you're diesel's diesel
can't even get close to any kehelmal diesel
i have never seen in my life

fools but not twins
they came for the child but someone killed him
the one who kept the knife
the wolf

he jumped on me
because he did it
now listen to this
that child was poisoned in the same way
like at the el sabaro wedding
it's el saguaro
 the same killer    yes
i like mcguire (macgyver = tv show)
damn it
the whole of japan is scared because of the theft of a poisonous snake
boom slang naya one of terrible venom
when they eat internal bleeding occurs

i'm very sorry i'm very sorry
i have this misfortune
i beat it
that why you what is that  
why did you try  
i was made to act i was just acting
i don't think they went to the store
want to buy women's clothes underwear  
but they believed it
they
i i drew them
you proved to be smarter than others
you're a winner
please
please
talk to your man
i will do anything
please
leave my son alone
your son
do you know how easy it is  
take him to the roof after me  
didn't think it would take you three hours
find out that the son is missing
you are a good father your son has to pay for it
you did everything wrong
you know nothing about life
how hard is it  
you
a prodigal girl broke their toys
when my mother told me to take him
sorry didn't mean to bother
what's going on here
but didn't you see a little white tribe  
wearing glasses leaving here  
not
then a silver box and a train sticker
struck in the face   did you see that  
i don't remember that
uncle kimura did you see  
a silver briefcase
did you mean train stickers  
yes shaped
that's strange it had train stickers
i have never seen anything like that
i think i remember
hmm
me uncle kimura  
yes ok
are you ok one
don't shave on a bullet train
no matter what anyone says
it's okay to ask you know  
i continue to follow him
ok ok it doesn't matter
go sorry uncle kimura
you guys be careful
one more thing
many people
many people think of suitcases
because this is a train going all night
but you said briefcase
i didn't say briefcase
i guess
i found diesel
you know who will be in kyoto by the time we arrive
hmmm
we have to get off the train now
if you think i'll get off the train without a lemon
or without the briefcase you're wrong
ok it's in the first class lobby
it's behind the bar in a trash can
it's yours
i'm getting off this
i'm going to find a temple
rethinking my choices or something
that sounds pretty good but here's the thing
i still need someone to take the blame
shik
 you need someone to blame  yes
not i understand
it's a bit of a puzzle
because i think
do i give him completely
or cut into pieces
will kehelmal push a momomon inside  
that's what's in my head right now
hmm
or
what   do you have another idea  
you know we have a wall behind us
but it's just an illusion
it's made up
because there is a window between that wall
a window of opportunity
come on it's a door
it
there is a door in the middle of the wall
i'm having a hard time understanding your story
i mean the door is closing now
now the question is who is diesel here  
 who is the duck here    duck  
it's a children's program
 thomas the train engine  it's close
thomas: the tank engine
please sir
this this guy kidnapped me
he said that he would keep me and take ransom
i'm very sorry i am confused by the white girl's tears
great common sense tells me
this is an old suspicious grandfather
is the leader
but i am very good at talking about people
something tells me you're not right
so let's see
i mean i can't shoot both
then i don't have to answer
you know how about this   you will love this
let's play a little game
huh   play if you like
raise both your hands
great i knew i would like it
you close your eyes
i count to three
the leader of the two of you
raise your hand
the nonleader should reach out to the other person
now both of you raise your hands
or both of them reach out to the other person
i know both are liars not telling the truth
then i shoot both of them ready
you said that both cannot be killed
can't get answers
 i said that didn't i    yes
sometimes shot first
then you have to find answers
one
if i didn't answer when you called
 two  kill the monster
three
am i dreaming  
sorry friend
not your lucky day
i have a wire in my bag
i think we can use it
lock the door outside
it's very scary
he said if i don't do what he says
or if i scream
that he does bad things to me
so why didn't you use it  
yes he kidnapped you
he gave you his gun right  
 slowly  no no i am
please

at the kyoto stop
that's the only way to get him on this train
the white queen
that's right
but he can't do it
he is dead now
a few boxes behind
they are both dead
my grandson was pushed off a roof
why do you think he was left unprotected  
my grandson is safe
my son is not dead
listen old man
the only thing you know
about an old man
he has survived so much more
much more than you
i will kill him myself
 are you okay    it  
you won't believe this is a coincidence
but i have already taken an antidote
i am fine
may be
that girl
his intentions are not good for you
ok
even a blind man can see that you are in the dark
i don't know about a blind man
he emphasized well
what did you do to him
i didn't want to do anything
fate does what it needs
why why do you laugh at fate  
destiny for me
another word for misfortune
it
coming after me
oh man something funny
my handler calls me ladybug
he is around
 ladybug    yes
that is very lucky
not he is sarcastic
don't think
i'm going to tell you a story
 no don't  it's short
no problem really
not very fast
no no no
that's a good story for you
no problem
here it is said
a long time ago
i promised myself
i give things for my family
whatever the cost
i came to a very good place
inside the minegishi crime family
a man came to take my place
a man from the north
i told minegishi not to believe him
minegishi told me that my hunger was quenched
he is not wrong
but i'm not wrong either
when i came back home
there was only ashes and blood
the white mare took everything from me
a lot
yuichi
yuichi
yuichi
i went to hide
i looked for a way to attack the white mare
so that i don't get into trouble with what's left of me
but could not reach
i didn't think
destiny will give me a chance to fix these things
do you know what a ladybug is called in japan  
in ten to um us
as a boy i was told she had a mark on her back
the seven sorrows of the world are depicted
see not luck in ten to um uz
they all have bad luck
may others live in peace
i don't want to keep seven sorrows
everything that happens to you
you were brought here
destiny
that's shit
at the kyoto stop
the white horse will board this train
i will finally get a chance to make everything right
my son was a few boxes ago
get him out of this if you can
i don't see the white horse
we will not let anyone get off this
leave it to me to worry about the white horse
ok

dry grapes a hungry man does not eat

do you think this kehelmal will survive the masks  
for so long
the weight of your betrayal was on your head
let me set you both free
my wife
took from me
i heard about it sorry
it's a dangerous accident
terrible no no no no
not
nothing in life is dangerous
it was an attempt to kill me
but fate
fate cast two operatives
for work in nyunnu bolivia
killed my entire team
i had to go look it up
he doesn't just take people lemon
not he asked the two responsible
bolivia to work
that is why
my wife was in that vehicle that night
without me
fate put my wife in the hospital
a piece of his ribs stuck in his heart
only for the best skilled cardiologist
he can be saved
but two days ago the doctor was poisoned
my goodness
destiny
fate again
they said i have money
not my opinion but you got the hornet
kill your own son  
 yes  okay
i did that a piece of shit
oh oh oh
that night i told him…
i will send someone to get it
don't go
wait till i come
but he promised it would be the last time
it's the last time we save him from trouble
i am coming i will always come for you
i think he is right
if i removed that weakness
from my life years ago
he is still with me
understand this it helps
i have a good doctor
i love my wife very much
he taught me a valuable lesson
if you don't control your destiny
it will control you
hmmm

i brought them all here to die
but now there is only one thing left

as a former union member of jablonski's
risks are high
let's see about that
northridge 2014 overturned rule 103
encino 2015 butchered a nest
when a kid next door has a birthday party
921 833 605 laws that were broken endangering the common people
the most confusing thing in all of them is not informing the legal departments at the right time
 it was a good hunt what happened there  the biggest thing is
in canoga park 2017
broken law 101 endangering the life of a union representative
he was seriously injured
he already had gout
all these incidents things that can be banned for life
but you have been warned again
why am i renewing your membership again  
ralph i'll tell you first
 bud here new guy  yes
is that so  
yes sir definitely i am a different person
i have given up
pork cartoons white women
bud i can't imagine
if you were in my place
sitting in front of a man like you
will you be taken in  
if that person stay in your problem admits the mistake
if you apologize like me
most of all i
look ralph
mr seagut i just
i really want to join this gotta do a good job
i promise if you give me a chance
i won't mess it up
one last chance
now that we've settled that part
while i refill my coffee you two finish the story
that's a great man a poor man
second chance is much appreciated
i don't know what that man sees in you mr jablonski
i know you guys worked together but i don't care
i've dedicated my life to getting cowboys like you out of this
so i'm waiting

carol
carol did you eat my yogurt again  
i also wrote my name on the lid today
how did you eat yogurt without tearing it without tearing my name
what can't you hear me
i blow air into the yogurt and you eat my air
the next
mr jablonski  
yes teeth
i see it this way i go to the elephant i do my job
you know mr mallet
this is broken a woman's
he looks like an old man about 90 years old
ninety   what if you check again  
 are you sure it's ninety    i am sure
haha
ok anything
total amount right  
i'm very sorry rule no 107 clearly states
i have said about the rules no problem
 the amount given for this tooth  okay i will take
however due to the low processing time
mr seeger asked me to inform you that your old dues should be paid early
that means $5000
$5000   i thought it was two thousand  
that's at 2017 prices mr jablonski
then 15% is deducted for each tooth
after that we have to keep 50% until we submit the documents
plus $10 is charged to your membership card
that gives you a free app from cheesecake factory
 i don't like cheesecake  do you have it  
why don't you take $10 for it   everything else is taken
don't you have any money   do you really want to share this  
ok you can go
is it  
if you have questions about this
carol is here to help you
great you have met the union representative

have you read the book
i haven't read it i'm going out
what do you know about vampires  
i know there are five types
south east spider uber juvenile
they are very much alone but when they come together there is a hierarchy
they are formed in order of age what else  
the only thing they fear is the sun
they can't make children but they can change people
say more  
 what about the familiar    do you think he is one of them  
i don't know you say
 hmm    i think he fits very well
 do you think so    definitely
very powerful vampires have powerful familiars
speaking of juvenile a little kid will love this one
he takes this cat and tries to change it
 come on  what  
not i am a cat lover i have two
ok
that's clear
 do you want to see a picture    not i don't want
maybe later
ok look here
this is his car
a place that has been closed for 18 months
this is great
 give me some advice    not
i mean frankly why are we going after juvenile  
why don't they come until they grow up and when the value of the teeth increases  
i could come back in september but now i don't have time
beggars have no choice
besides you don't want to see them eat people do you  
wait why don't you have time  
 why do you ask so many questions    i just
staying in this car and taking care of your business
stay in the car   can't i want to be with you all the time
 rules of the society  except to keep you alive
i don't care about rules
no no you don't understand always
you should stay inside the car with that in mind here goes
 what   no i don't believe in guns  you don't believe these  
not they are rude they kill people
these are not for me
when i was a kid i tried to shoot a squirrel
couldn't do it right  
i still see his little face in my dreams
lane makes noises for the little one still afraid of dreams
lane makes noise huh  
 what does the lane sound like    it's like
something i don't want to talk about it
stay in the car
this can't happen
how did you get here
this afternoon
you've been a bad boy troy
don't you know that a vampire can't live without this plant  
but for some reason some god's bad joke
they are the only ones we cannot rebuild
a vampire is everything to be a predator
inside these teeth
each one was a life could have lived for thousands of years
in the end you are a part of the life
but it's not always like this is it  
there was a time when people worshiped us like gods
right in this valley you built temples of blood and bones for us
then you turned against us
do you know something  
i'm taking our things back
one property is sold once
as i see it you have two choices two doors
one you can live to serve me on your knees
the second one
do not do that
ok what the hell do you want huh  
who brought you this tooth  
a name
you're a piece of shit girl
do you think god  
you are not god big mistake
you had a genetic mutation and you could have died
if there were no caves to hide in
the second door then
no no no
do not
time for the tooth fairy
ah
hello sir
how are we doing this good morning  
breaking enough laws to report  
he's definitely going that way
but nothing has been confirmed yet
where is he now
he left me in the car to a bowling alley
didn't you follow him  
i thought he was going to shoot me it is very difficult to understand him sir
child do you want a promotion  
do you want carol's desk  
so get off your ass go in and confirm the illegal stuff
ah what the hell
 bud    seth
 seth  shik
 bud  quickly shoot
i didn't bring my gun
give me my gun
i'm just a bystander
if you don't give me the gun they'll bite
chic chic chic
wow i'm very sorry
next time i say give me the gun you give me the gun
 get down now  what  
i mean get down

do you know
we'll leave you behind
i don't want them rubbing on my new seats
 what   are you real  of course
come on have to go
keep your legs back and let the air dry
hey hey
 you forgot your purse  wait count it
you will need some of these
i'm sure you know mr samiti but when the vampires are killed
they release a gas into our body so that other vampires can catch it
so they should all be removed here take this
this is my special mix a little different right  
 put these on when you shower  my goodness
every inch of you right  
be very careful do not rub these in the eyes
whatever you do
do not apply these to the rectum
what happens if it goes to the anus  
it won't kill you but
my goodness
also close your doors and don't come out after dark
 do you know something    what

violation of rule #101 killing vampires and not informing the society
violation of rule no 276 sneaking in without permission of the society

 i want to write everything down  not so
this to seeger kick me out of the union isn't that good  
you killed me a little more yesterday

i told you to stay in the car that's why i work alone
listen are you going to die licking the boss's ass  
he had nothing else to do for me right  
listen to me mr samiti

we should call the union and wait for them to come
 law number 233 means if you see a hunter  laws   i don't care about them
a suspicious death of a common man he gets suspended for 30 days
we don't have 30 days i don't care about them

my wife and daughter are moving to florida
that means if you call seeger i'll lose my family
i'm very sorry
yes it will be
then you say you want me
but
not no i didn't say i wanted you i didn't say that
 i mean  i didn't say that

 any relationship that makes you happy  listen
i mean
as a man give me the weekend
ok until the weekend
ok
see what are you asking me to do   if i keep he will develop some suspicion
calm down
i got a tip about this house from big j
why don't you look in the front drawer  
yes
that's what we do here
that's what we do
these are garlic grenades
when the pin is pulled garlic and wood dust come out cleaning the room
i guess haven't really used it yet
but in theory that's what it should be
an unsanctioned weapon for my first true vampire fight
 that's great thank you  shik shik
what what  
crazy nazarene brothers
wait nazarian brothers they are great hunters
yes but not bigger than me
they've completely cleaned up glendale now going west

 i'm a big fan  do you want to take a selfie  
what are you doing in simi valley

we let you do the hard work
they let you find out which house the items are hidden in and then you know
you got me in trouble i did the work but not for you

don't shoot where they are shoot where they go
are you ready let's go
why garlic  
if a vampire comes near me i put in their eyes
shake their heads

great bro

seth my gun
 big money baby  huh   this is what i mean
 isn't this great    very good
what happened to you pee your pants  
that's my thing
 bro  what are you doing   what do
listen pee boy this is a man's world not a boy's
he will have to be given a pampas but listen carefully okay  
i take this and pay my daughter's school fees do you know
that's why i was here
one is trying to run
i will keep
 he got up again she is a vampire  i know
it's changed here now
i heard they were selling sun cream
it's so thick they can stay out in the sun for 15 to 20 minutes
they are made from the shells of desert tortoises
they are illegal in 40 countries right  
vampire sunscreen   here   i don't like it that much
 hey wait this doesn't make sense  what  
this is a spider but that is an uber
this is a southern
that one from the east you can tell by these front teeth
in this valley it's like they're mixing races
no these vampires never choose to live together
uber is for single people
spiders coexist but never with eastern and southern ones
 they steal food  listen to this child huh  
this joker thinks he knows more than the geniuses after reading a few books
no no wait wait he makes a good point
but
but i don't have time i have to go and get the little one come on
remove the teeth why don't you go to the bathroom and empty your bladder  
are you ok
i don't know
i keep thinking how those vampires we killed
that they became ordinary people
here's the thing
thinking that vampires are just like us
but they don't seth
you know what i see in a vampire   a big dollar sign
because they are all murderers and liars
this is not brad pitt wearing a leather jacket and looking for blood
this is not eclipse this is not new moon this is not breaking down part one (twilight tales)
this is not like that right  
why do you know the names of all the twilight movies  
why are you so angry with breaking down part two  
it gives the final meaning to the entire twilight saga
what haven't you seen the second one  
bella now has a child of her own that's crazy
 did he have a baby    ah if i were you
to know it for the first time you deserve a gift
my daughter inspired it i don't quite understand them
but you have something different seth
you are stronger than you think
not
i mean really
don't tell seager you're telling me that
not like that that's what you have i'm telling you you have an innate ability
you could have been a good hunter
i'm telling you now

you might have to look at your teeth
about my teeth  
yes just look there is a mirror in hand
ah
come on
it's not that good
 what it was completely involuntary  it must be a pipe tooth
i'm sorry it was my mistake
how do you feel  
the thought of being a vampire is terrifying
 ok ok  but more precisely
 i don't know seems a bit wild  yes like
it's like my blood is on fire
like drinking a lot a lot of energy drinks
i can feel everything
god did i screw up this time  
no no no no problem
 does it have a sign    not no problem

 i had nothing to do  i don't care about spies
this is stupid bud let me explain
ok listen
because of you my family was kidnapped my friend is dead
or not dead
so i don't mind the questions
that's what he does bud
he changes people unwillingly
i'm not used to it either he did this to me
do you think i want to work with a monster like her  
so what do you do  
 he made me right    what  
another uber vampire
he forced me to go to you
he wanted to get revenge for what you did to him
what are you saying
he wanted to find a way to hurt you
why  
you can burn a finger huh  
you killed a vampire on monday didn't you  
 beautiful old lady    not really pretty
that's audrey's daughter

paige don't talk to him
he has a right to know
you can't decide
i had a daughter just like you
i wanted to give him a better world

my goodness
i told you clearly

original
serious violation rule 682 working outside your shift
indeed sir i would say
rule 741 states if a hunter in a 911 situation
he can skip working hours
if he had been informed before entering the society” he did
thank you thanks for that
here are 584 more laws to unlawfully kill those who know them well
without prior approval
yes sir that's right but in section 4
when the shot has been fired the hunter is allowed to shoot again
that's what happened here
rule 424 states a club hunter must make all reasonable efforts
to minimize damage to property during hunting
boom
 sir rule 42  i will say this
law 424 was repealed by the national office of the arts this january
boom boom
 who has read it    saw it in the newspaper
yes i can see what's going on here
haha
gaps

it's a trap if i tried to save you they'd catch us both
nonsense you wanted to keep the disguise
i am a pawn in your mission nothing else
 i saved you you were brought out of iran  then why didn't you come with me  
this is the reason
because you chose the cia over your own child

how good it is that both my children study there
yes dad
both can come and go together
 we have money left over for petrol  yes father
when guddu gets a job in two years you can buy his books and that money will be saved
yes dad
think about it son
behind every successful man is a woman
behind every middle class man is a son who sits on the back of his scooter
every day we hear things like this
that's why middle class kids like us can never be happy
dad's favorite word like the characters in old movies
bachavo (save/save)
 do you understand son    yes father
 limit unnecessary expenses  okay dad
 dad how lucky i am  why  
good time guddu brother was not a girl

kishanchand there is no doubt that he is the same as the name
it is labeled as a place for those who have no money
burdened by the expectations of middleclass parents
inherited a terrible disease  mediocrity
its symptoms are very familiar

look son of yudi we are working very hard to earn this money do you understand
now go to your room go
go son
sleep all night son
went to distribute food
did you waste that money  
money is there to spend
mother gets up early in the morning and prepares food for the whole month
that's how you make money
also parents want to give money to their children
i give as much as i can
who decides the status of these two   aren't i  
i am not free to go with my friends and spend 100 to 200 rupees what is wrong  
don't i feel the same way  
500 is not a lot for them in oakwood this house is worth it
do you think that i get up early in the morning and do tutoring for fun  
you are a good son sir
are you a vagrant  
i am a rascal because i'm not you
if you want to learn learn i don't want
i don't want to be like my father
you can never be like dad
it doesn't have to be
i want a better life think big
even if you go to a hotel like your father all your life you don't have to go through the menu 
study for your exam tomorrow then it can be one

i also cut the pipe of your scooty
it was made from the 500 you gave yourself
i don't regret it because i love spending time with you
and i missed you so much
liar
i remembered you too
what the hell are you doing  
you have now fallen into saisha's circle why meet ash now  
why do you say you meet   the bet is not the end of the friendship
he is my good friend like you and me we are in the same class
besides it is very clear to me that i want saisha to be my girlfriend
look yudi this is what you like about saishabecause it temporarily distracts you from reality
pannu i am not a small person i know what i'm doing
listen saisha told me her story
but ash is not the type of person saisha says
there is something wrong with the two of them
i want to solve their problem and when i solve their problem i will stop talking to ash
do not tell lies that break stones
we are talking about honesty so tell us what really happened
it was my mistake
i should not have made that stupid bet
what bet
is she single
who said this  
our sister
 yes i am single but with you i will not make friends for life
do you know all my work  
i don't know much about you
but i know about my best friend and her likes and dislikes
it won't work for you
are you a braggart or a best friend  
math pass or fail  
he went to please him you'll get depressed so stay away
is it so let's do some work and see before i go
who is impressed who is depressed
let's see
shall we place a bet  
good
rahul came for a month the 3 of us were together
when they became friends ud really i forgot about the bet
but it broke rahul's status
i didn't know how or when he won aisha's heart
they became very close in a short time
when i realized that saisha is very serious about rahul
i wanted to stop it
ashna enough
i am very hungry do you want to eat
 no  you  
no
rahul he is getting serious stop that
we took that bet as a joke stop cheating on him
i will go and tell him everything
no no no ash please please don't do this
why do you think i'm joking  
i know we bet on the game but now i'm serious
i like her in fact i am in love with her
 you're not lying  of course not i swear
if this continues we start a relationship
rahul listen saisha is very precious to me
she is my best friend i don't want her to get hurt
you won't hurt her
no ash trust me sister
that will never happen
 promise me  we both want to give
i promise that will not happen i gave the word
why didn't you tell saisha  
after what saisha told me i didn't even want to see her face
i didn't even say no
remember who  
are you acting like my best friend 24 hours a day  
bet on my feelings  
are you a friend
you tricked me with your cousin
what did rahul leave you  
i can't even believe this
 let me talk to him  no no don't
i don't need any help ash
i don't need you or your nonsense
who are you you are nobody except a parasite feeding on me
people know you because you are with me
guys date you because they want my number
or no one will even look
your name is ashna tripathi but your identity is saisha's best friend
oh shit sorry former
wow all these years of friendship then this is what you think of me  
yes
 you think i'm dependent on you    yes
do you think i'm a parasite  
 isn't it    really saisha  
even if i see your face i get bored i hate you
if you get tired of seeing me get out of my house
i will happily leave this house and your life
let's see if this happens to you
i didn't think saisha thought about me like that
the same thing happened to her it happened to her because of my mistake
she is not that kind of girl
how do you know  
we are in the same class so understand
i cried for a month
i decided that i would not make friends anymore

lamain this christmas party we are raising funds for palak ngo
the principal is targeting all of you together
5 lakhs will be collected through a fundraising campaign
the good news is to donate funds to the palak orphanage
i can suggest that the more volunteers
you will get the job done better
just a moment
ok
yudhisthir you have been called to the principal's office
please go
yes ma'am did you call me
yudhisthir i was just talking to your father
he has given you the full amount for the fees
but still there is a deficit of 20000 in your account
he gave money i spent it
why if i may ask  
pretend to have money
of course almost all the kids at oakwood are rich
but i'm not like that
so i thought it was imperative to stay that way
or you will be cornered
i just wanted to fit in
but i didn't think that all the money would be wasted
i'm sorry dad
i appreciate your honesty
mr sharma you have to pay the remaining fees within one month
otherwise your son's admission will be cancelled
i can't pay again ma'am
do what you have to do thank you
dad wait a minute father
dad wait a minute listen
but never lie to me
if i ever find out that you lied to me i will be very sad son
i will feel that i did not make you right
aunty ash
just one minute ash i'm very sorry
 ash wait a minute please listen to me  don't touch me
i have done you a great wrong i'm really sorry but listen to me just once
please mom tell him to go

i messed everything up bro
i don't have anyone
wake up ud

udi you are the one who needs to do something
you have been doing what you want for so long
they are not right i made a big mistake
udi mistakes are called mistakes because they are done unconsciously
now you realize your mistake
now do what you think is right

because you are not a bad person you are my brother
you did what your heart told you
now think carefully and do something
 yudhishthir sharma    yes sir

vehicle documents  
here is the insurance license and photocopy
download the speedy delivery app
take your uniform and come to work from monday
ok sir
brother you are just like an actor

more deliveries more bonus
then the college fees can be paid soon all the best
hey delivery boy  
you have bonuses
thank you
so what's the point madam  
why did you think i would like that  
actually ma'am my mom is the best cook in the world
north indian south indian mughlai continental chinese anything
if we are allowed to have a booth at the fundraiser
you can definitely make twice as much profit as you think
i sampled from 4 top caterers in the last 4 days
i look a little older
what ma'am if you take off your glasses you can definitely sit in my class
flattery doesn't matter ud
i am sorry i have now decided that this is the best dish
this pickle they are the ones who work
awesome many thanks
why are you thanking me i mean i'm sorry
because this pickle took the deal
the ones you just ate were made by my mother herself
i actually swapped your caterer's tiffin boxes with my mom's
i'm sorry ma'am i had no choice thank you so much bye
but trust me if you take off your glasses i can make you sit in my class
thank you ma'am bye
that thief has created a misunderstanding between them
it needs to be removed quickly
otherwise these two will be enemies for the rest of their lives
thinking that both are wrong
one person dies after drinking sanka pills and the other person starts rapping
then why do you think i would do that  
you are fine bro
stop joking
alex you're both friends saisha and ash
you know how much they miss each other
but both of them are not talking to you now why bother  
what is the benefit to you  
it's not good to work while looking for benefits
where are you going bro   whose stuff are those  
it's yours
of our  
brother those are not ours you must have come to the wrong address
a251 pratap road shiv colony
that's our address right
aunt's stuff is also yours
and money for this  
it has been paid
who paid  
16900 where did this money come from  
that is my salary for one month father
did you keep it to pay for your college fees  
yes
but i won't go back to oakwood
so you don't go to college  
go mom going to kishanchand
when guddu and i go together we have money left over for petrol
he is the one who brought me all these things
good good great son
at first he stole 20000 to be cool
after that they are asked to pay fees and waste it in this way
good if kishanchand wants to go kishanchand runs away to oakwood if you want to go to oakwood then run to oakwood
if you want to learn learn or just stay
but forgive us we can't fix you
let go
are you trying to say that rahul lied to both of us  
what a scumbag
shit shit
i told ash so many things
thanks alex

 and when we are together    best

i'm good but he can't catch me
the worst thing is that my best friend made such a bet on me
why did you do that ash  
god

it's a stupid joke that went too far please forgive me
i'm sorry too to the stories i told you

the important thing is that you are together again
thank you
and i'm glad that you both got to clear the misunderstanding

come come give entertainment

last time i went to entertain you and got slapped
so don't go to say i love you this time
 donkey  or you will be hit again
i really say i love you
back  
there is nothing to fear because he always beat me
what kind of story is this or a story of violence  
this story is about a family of superheroes
every hero is second to none
hero number 1 superman
middle class indian father
when one superman struggles to save the world
the other person worries about saving money in every way
one superman flies up with his red underpants on
the other says don't fly
do only what you can
it will definitely happen
hero no 2 wonder woman
our mothers are there
now look wonder woman never admits defeat
so our mothers are also the same there is no difference
no matter what store she goes to in the world she never loses in a purchase
not only will the price of the retailer be reduced
getting free stuff is not a game
totally agree bro
see if you can do it
hero number 3 captain america
the first son in the house
one in everything first in the class
first not only in eating but also in the excretion of digested food
he owns everything from toothpaste to tv remotes
and i'm just like whatfirst
escaped from the thread
a great one
with so many superheroes there must be a villain  
so the villain in this story is the little son (elohssa) mr elohssa
what a twisted name bro
just like the name so is the man
he thought he was better than others
he thought how come i was born in this middle class family
he thought that he should be born in a family of billionaires somewhere
true true
mr elosa had a single purpose in life
being cool in front of everyone
he didn't care if he had to lie or take shortcuts
he just wanted to be cool
guess what his superpower is  
tell yourself man
running fast
ran away from everything
from problems from truth from duties from oneself and from one's own
daughters and daughters abandoned everyone who claimed to be their own
he tried to be cool and hurt his friends
then life gave him a super slap in the face so that he could see the daytime stars
who raised him after he fell  
who
his heroes
oh
the fool understood only when the heroes helped him
that he can become a hero even from zero when his people are with him
true story
that's when this idiot realized captain america his older brother
that the first in everything was the first to be beaten by parents
when mr elosa was sleeping hugging a pillow at home
get up every morning
pithi anala is the first to pay bills and help with daily chores
oh good brother
wonder woman looks like my mom
what did you do after saving rupees for years  
he bought a scooty
i can go to college comfortably
he is a loiterer on the bus
often i ate a lot of her free food
superman is the father of every house
asking us to live as we have
that's because we want to make our dreams come true
200 to make their own glasses without spending
but they gave me one and a half lakhs at once to send me to oakwood
why   because then i can make my dreams come true
maybe our fathers don't fly like superman
but they always wanted to put us above everyone else
so what did mr elosa learn  
he learned that what is really cool is being a real man
so true
where to tell who do you want to say love to  
oh shit forgot
ok do we all love our parents  
 yes  right  
but we never say it openly
especially for dads
alas why are you always far away in the name of honor  
so today let's put this distance aside and open up
my father is here
take care of the coolest dad in the world
hey mr sharma
 great uncle  my superman
mr sharma do not be shy
i love you
this is the best way to say love
i wonder about my only father
he never left the stick
and when his anger falls to the sky
his shoes fly towards my face
a really good one
but who is this wicked elosa  
come on (elohssa) elohssa i elohssa you elohssa can be anyone
i am  
elohsano ma'am not you
neither are you mother no father either
did i mention that elohssa is a bit naughty  
look back and read
the donkey
 donkey  you said that you are one
why didn't you wear a fancy dress  
what's the difference it's my last day
you're not going anywhere okword fees have been paid
dad but
 oakward not oakwood  run before i get the shoe for you
saisha ash i have some bad news for you guys
what  
i'm not leaving oakwood
are you crazy  
now we are in the same class for two years
that's why you have to be friends
 friends    guys
 guys  guys
hey are you crazy   come on
listen he has two girls
you don't have one try to be cool
ok ok maybe you will wait
ohwait a minute you are fine my son
see i have had enough experience
but i own the ups and downs my ups and downs
i finally did it
eventually i became a really cool guy

# from pinocchio2022websrt
if you ask a star for a wish
your dreams come true
isn't it a beautiful song   how so  
rahaiya is the name exactly jimmy
i am here again to tell a small part of a story
it is a story that started a long time ago
actually it starts at the same time a long time ago
that's right it is good it's fine
i never understood the one and the same time thing
hey who's telling the story   you or me
ok who are you
i am you but he is old and wise
for real how did you know  
because i am the bookkeeper telling this story
i know exactly what is going on in your journey
really   let me hear this can i warm up again  
keep walking you will find out for yourself
you are a great talker
shall i continue  
say say what's in your heart
thank you
once upon a time long ago
my travels took me to a small beautiful village
master gapito wood carvers clocks toys makers
fancy stuff huh   looks like a place that suits me
maybe something here
a little behind the ear
not a boy a toy for the puppeteer
huh  
looking back i feel lonely without him again
young at heart life is new
who could have been
i see him in my dreams clearly
if i could make those dreams come true
i will never see
these feelings in my mind
memories are the key
for feelings when he was with me
there were many laughs
but we didn't get to see
it could have been happily ever after never
if this is more than a memory
but memories happen
as seen by the eyes of this old man
that's how it was
when he was here
with me
ok
hmm not so ugly
wow
sorry ma'am
this is it
and ah
figaro the job is done what do you think huh  
really  
i think he is a lot like her
very far
no figaro mr rizzy is here again
i'm sorry mr risi we closed at exactly 6:04
at sunset
ok gepito sorry to bother you
i saw the light in your light bulbs i thought i'd ask you one more time
please sell that koha's watch
with a crocodile with that beautiful duck
this watch is not for sale as i have said many times
i will give you 20 lira 30
tell me yours gepetto i will pay
they are priceless sir
i'm sorry but i can't sell any of those watches
if you can't sell those watches why put them in a store  
it's a complicated story give me a music box  
good night geppetto i go with regret
they don't understand do they cleo   my watches are worth more than anything else
my watches are the most special creations
i made them for my dear constanza
he loves them all
for each one
ah but not as much as my boyfriend
hmm
my love boy
there are sad stories huh   time to be happy
that's why i gave you a smile you can always be happy
what is your name
you should have a name for yourself ok ok what is dana's name  
what should happen  
i made you out of wood
i made it out of pine wood
a boy made of pine
from the pines pinocchio huh  
pinocchio ok
ah
do you like the name pinocchio  
yes yes
did you see figaro   do you like the name pinocchio  
yes yes yes
come on hey
hey do not
let's dance
wow wow
do you call this music  
don't be afraid figaro do not
why   because he likes you
ah oh
figaro no no no
cleo also thinks he's handsome
figaro come don't be a scaredy cat
ah figaro
what  
ok ok the time is now
wait a minute wait a minute
ok
now time to sleep
yes
good night cleo my little aquatic baby
good night
good night my beautiful birthday boy
oh
what a beautiful clear night beautiful
figaro look how pinocchio is outside the moon
he looks like a real boy
look at figaro there there there a wishing star
ah
i haven't seen one in a while
we have to make a wish huh  
the moon is out the shining moon the first star i saw tonight
i wish
hmm
i wish
how do you say this  
i wish
wish
figaro do you want to know what my wish is  
no no if i told you that you'd think i
the problem with that watch is that it reads too much
got it got it that reads too much tick ​​tock is the clock ticking too much  
forget it it's too late now
still
if my wish comes true figaro that's great
great
my god he lives
look at this what is going on  
 god you can walk  god you can walk
shut up you can talk
shut me up you can talk
 not you can talk  not you can talk
 i know i'm talking you can too  i know i'm talking you can too
ok ok ok ok ok
everyone calm down i'm here now what's going to happen here
i see what the problem is
i am living and breathing an angel
you're not real are you  
surely he is true isn't it  
 then who are you    dear jimmy
an insect loves freedom who are you then  
good geppetto made a wish deep in his heart so i came
 i am the blue angel  i am the blue angel
 no i am the blue angel  no i'm the blue angel
i see what the problem is here
 let's try again i am the blue angel  hello blue angel
that's good yes i am the blue angel
 what is your name now    i don't know
i heard gepetto named him pinocchio
my name is pinocchio
it looks like your head is made of white pine that's pinocchio
a great name for a boy made of wood
 am i a boy    yes a wooden boy
gepetto a woodcutter but a carver i think  
yes i guess you could call him pinocchio's father
 father    yes father
i mean if only pinocchio was a real boy
if gepetto wanted a real boy why did he make a puppet  
there are definitely other ways to make a boyfriend
but i don't think geppetto goes out much
i think what he can do best is with weapons
definitely i'm just a bad reader
therefore it does not define what is true
 blue angel am i real    yes pinocchio you are real
a real living puppet painted like a real living boy
closer to what your father wished for
then when will i be a real living boy  
because it seems like a way to please my father
a little doll made out of pine and geppetto's wish granted
but his feelings are tangled and knotted like a coil
then a star gave life to a toy with the wonder and joy of a puppet boy
but you have to pass an exam to be a real person
gepetto has done his part i did my part too
it's up to you now to become a real person
you have to prove that you are brave truthful and not selfish
how do i do that  
by learning the difference between wrong and right
 okay how do i do that    your conscience says so
hardasa   who are they
no no confession singular noun singular
conscience is a small voice that many people refuse to listen to
that is the biggest problem facing the world today
are you my conscience  
huh   i am   not i am not a conscience
i am a liar an insect rather than an instinct
would you like to be his conscience  
i am   please don't i have things to do
really   i see a lost soul an insect without an address
an aimless vagrant hopping from stove to stove
no direction no job no purpose or future in life
look at this
if someone sneaks into someone's house and warms their ass
he may have been driven from several places but
 okay you are right  here's the thing
do you know the difference between wrong and right  
tell you i know
i mean an insect in good condition
whatever you have heard about me
then that too was resolved mr kneeling
i hereby appoint you as pinocchio's conscience
 temporal conscience  okay temporal conscience
until pinocchio has one of his own
henceforth you are supreme in the knowledge of right and wrong
also when the trusted advisor becomes guilty
arise sir jimmy
hey this is awesome
do your work let conscience make the reputation show the right way
for now my dear pinocchio it is time for me to go
god he's talking beautifully again are we becoming the same  
pinocchio a boy who is brave truthful and unselfish
his father is proud
the most important thing in becoming a real child is not how one is born
on what is in the heart
fate is kind
she brings loved ones
a delicious filling
satisfies their hearts
like blue lightning
destiny comes and sees through you
when you wish upon a star
your dreams
to be true
what is that   i heard something
i heard something
i heard something
figaro figaro did you hear something too  
i heard something
to you  
did you hear something figaro  
i heard something yes heard
i heard i heard something
how are you   cleo did you hear something  
 pinocchio did you hear something    definitely heard
ok i heard something too now talk to you
hello dad
this is me pinocchio
 you are talking  yes i can walk
how   how do you walk how do you talk
blue angel he said you made a wish
blue angel   blue angel
i made a wish i asked my
i know a real boy but do you know  
i'm pretty much a real guy i can be that person
i have to do a lot of work
too much of a boy  
pretty much a boy
ahha
a very real boy
a very real boy
look look at you you are a very real boy
we can we can be a family
ah a very real boy
we need to play some music
dance can you dance too pinocchio  
i will make the best wooden shoes
then we sing and dance all day long
if you are beaten i will come to paste
i will take care of you
definitely
pinocchio pinocchio
pinocchio pinocchio is my son made of wood
pinocchio pinocchio i think you
shall i come too   thank you
you think it's good
after that pinocchio became a member of geppetto's family
except for some small family problems
they became a stable settled family
pinocchio
pinocchio i thought
now is the time for you to go to school
really dad   really  
wow
dad what's that shiny thing  
ah it
that sun my son
it goes around the earth once a day it's just plain simple science
you will learn about it in school
ah these are your school friends ah vitelli bongiono
gepetto
ah ah pinocchio wait wait
figaro yes it's been a long time now i forgot
this is your textbook this apple is for your teacher
turn now let me look at you
ah
very handsome
now pinocchio
this city is very complicated
there are many ways to turn pay attention
if you get lost remember we're two streets down from the fountain
i will come straight home after school
i'll be right here when you come back
we have dinner at exactly 5:00 pm
ok dad exactly at 5:00
that's right you go
ah ah no no no
figaro figaro he's going
my boy
ah miss sophia
ah i have some pretty good junk
get it here
hmm yamyamyam
hmmm
i miss him already right   yes yes
i miss him too
figaro already are you lonely without him  
yes yes going to school will be good for him
at school   my goodness what time is it now  
i was late on my first day at work
don't eat me don't eat me don't eat me
calm down i don't like insects i like dirt
thank you that's a relief i thought i was done
 my name is rahiya jimmy is wrong  nice to meet you i am sofia
you look like you're new in town this is a very small
sorry sofia sorry to interrupt
but i'm pinocchio's conscience i overslept
can you do me a big favor and take me to school  
did you sleep on the job  
who knows when the conscience is right  
 in my days  sofia i really want to go to him
this little puppet you walk the streets without a conscience
can you imagine the trouble he could get into  
i don't want that to happen
ok right or wrong mr grab the hat
ha ha ha stromboli the old thief is back in town
gideon remember that time i tied you up  
made you look like a puppet  
remember when he got caught   how did he beat
ah
gideon listen
the beautiful smile of innocent children on their way to school
their thirsty minds are looking for sources of knowledge
school a great institution
what will happen to this stupid world without it  
look at that a wooden boy
a wooden boy look at that gideon that's great
a living puppet without strings
ah
gideon that kind of thing brings luck to one
let me see who pays for a living doll
that's right stromboli he will even give his eyes and teeth
i can't wait to go to school to learn what these are
quickly let's catch him
oh my god my miss i'm so sorry
 i hope you are not hurt  injuries  
broken damaged damaged beyond repair
i'm not broken
thank god you seem to be made of strong oak
i'm on foot that's why i say
yes on foot we cannot make everything from the best wood
like a good scholar a man of letters
i suppose you are on your way to a lecture at the academy of sciences  
not on my way to school
then i can learn a lot and be a real boy and please my father
a real boy  
why do you have to be a real boy so you can be popular  
 popular    yes popular
i speak in a theater
bright lights music applause fame
fame   but i want to be true
yes yes my boy
but you know a lot of people say you're not real
until everyone knows about you  
why being popular is true until then you are nobody
do you want to be nobody   not nobody wants to be nobody
everyone who has been somebody wants to be somebody
but my father said that i should go to school
definitely parents are like that but he didn't steal your intelligence
who needs an education  
such a person appearance body  
why he is a born actor ok gideon
he is not just an actor but an entrepreneur not someone to name
and wouldn't your father be proud  
 really    definitely
he will see your name in public six feet tall eli
 what is your name    pinocchio
pinocchio
pino
maybe k doesn't matter lots of letters
we want a simple strong name
slab oakley chad log
ok chris pine
it doesn't work we are wasting precious time
do you want to make your dad proud  
 definitely  then  
 okay i will be popular  ok
high diddledeedee
i have an actor's life
high silk clothes a silver bracelet a gold watch a diamond belt
hi diddlydeedee
a life of an actor
being famous is great for me the life of an actor
there i can see him straight ahead
sorry friend sorry going through
thank you sophia
what
jiminy what are you doing up there  
what who who are we talking to   who is jiminy   wait wait i can't
where is that where are we looking   you say
jiminy you know   i don't want to go to school
i am popular instead that makes dad proud
ok now calm down son remember what i said about temptations  
there he is
no no that's mr honest john he is my agent
honest john  
pinocchio as a rule of thumb
if someone calls himself honest he is not
especially if they are agents
as your conscience clearly appoints
i'm telling you forget the big ideas of being popular
go to school
that's what your father wants too
but honest john said that my father also wants to make me popular
like i said kids honest john isn't
but you said that if someone says they are honest they are not
 who do i trust    that is the oldest problem
but i believe in the one who appointed the blue angel are you the same  
 dear jimmy temporal conscience    then i want to go to school
now we are talking on that side of the school
hey pinnock put down the hammer
come on
hang in there pinocchio
come on they need to do something about this stone road
these days heavy cart wheels bore through a stone like this
someone was injured
 why do we in mount sam pay taxes    what are taxes  
it's nothing to worry about
now you won't be popular
but you have to learn about school
one pay attention two respect the rules
three listen to the teachers
 got it    realized
 won't you come with me    no pinnock
many schools do not treat insects well
they swarm me with cockroaches and weevils
i'll be here until your school is over
 look to go home by 3:17  okay jiminy
wow did you see what i said  
a good child isn't he   this is the good news
apparently pinocchio will be really brave truthful and selfless
also he listens to his conscience
you might think i did this
but old jimmy came here every now and then from his incompetence
out going out
go out and stay out
school is for real children
not for puppets puppets belong in puppet shows
come on
ok i will come
hey what's up   take me out
let me go out
this is a tragedy a trick
i don't think that teacher likes me
who cares what he thinks his way of teaching is completely old fashioned
is his curriculum for children   aiming for a grownup brain  
i do not think he does not allow different ways of learning
he said i don't belong all the children laughed at me
definitely puppets are there to make people laugh
alas poor misunderstood boy didn't you see
you are not suited to a traditional education environment
you get it wrong just like every great performer that walks the earth
school is for normal fluid normal lazy stupid little kids
not for smart artists like you
you want fame fame and fortune
 but my father  he wanted to send you to school and you went
you went to school you tried old school
then what did the wise school say  
he said i belong in a puppet show
ah a puppet show i say the same thing
 we are talking now  do not
on to stromboli fame awaits
hi diddlydeedee
an actor's life for me
a shiny beard a coat with gloves a pony cart and a friendly goat
high diddlydeedum
an actor's life is fun
the cart drives around inside a theater with its hair done
i stop at a sweet shop and get it an actor's life for me
no pinocchio don't listen to him
do not don't listen to him
no pinocchio do not
do not
the time is 5:00
it's time for pinocchio did he get lost  
he is lost
come on everyone
yes you too are figaro figaro
i haven't left this shop
but
we have to find pinocchio
ladies and gentlemen
end my great show
stromboli the great showman
the greatest show on earth
it is me
with the special permission of the management
but i am
i present to you something that you do not want to believe
introducing the eighth wonder of the world
the only puppet that can dance and sing without the help of strings
a toy that thinks it's a boy
so it's true stromboli finds a magic puppet with his ugly hand
my condolences to you
do you want them again  
 you're good  i am pinocchio
i came here to become a father so that i can be a real boy and make my father proud
i'm fabiana i'll never be popular
until i find a way
at this young age escape the puppet show
it doesn't matter today is not good enough for me sorry
 why are you stringing me along    part of the play
stromboli's last minute trick did you see loose knots
you haven't met sabina yet have you   i think you two will be friends
apparently his legs are strong
your legs are strong too are they made of pine  
yes but they will come true soon
will try tonight
 best wishes (break a leg talk)  really  
no no not really
ah
do your legs hurt  
it's a big story but it gets better every day
the same puppet can sing dance and sing without the help of strings
a toy that thinks it's a boy
the one and only pinocchio
i have no rope to hold me
slip me seduce me
a stupid puppet
one more time
i have no rope to hold me
slip me seduce me
i had ropes but now that i am free i have no ropes
hiho maryho that's the only way
i want the world to know that nothing bothers me
i don't have any ropes so i'm having fun and i'm not attached to anything
they have ropes but you see i have no ropes
i don't have any cords
thank you thank you thank you
thank you thank you
i may not be an actress
but i always dance
i may not have bowed to a partner but i know love
half human half puppet
practice how to spin with the toes
i quit every time i am released without apology
i always dance and dream about my curves
they will see me fall to the ground with one look
they will smile and talk to me but i need help to walk
but i always am
dancing
start with tango and then salsa
then the rumba and then we chachacha
two steps quick feet two steps ball feet
merengue bachata mambo bomba plena samba
kathak kabuki and more…
you need the foot and the rhythm and the stage
you will find your flow when you let go
let go like a child and let it run wild
to do what is possible and not to do what is impossible like french girls do
what is this nonsense  
no one shows up on my show for free
get ready now we leave in an hour
and you
uh uh my little pinocchio
i was scared to death that you were lost or stolen
we don't want that do we  
we leave in an hour
 here  let me go let me go from here
 this will be your home  help
 where i can always find you  come on
no no no
yes yes you belong to me
let me go let go from here help father
father   no parent wants trouble like you
oh no
parents want real children
jiminy dad help help
come on help
please
my little gold mine
pinocchio
pinocchio
gepetto i'm in this bottle
 pinocchio  gepetto gepetto
pinocchio
figaro cleo where could he be  
pinocchio
gepetto
shh shh
pinocchio pinocchio
i'm here above on the ceiling
stromboli is a dangerous man wicked but we are here to help you
leave me alone
we are going to find a way to get you out of that cage
did you hear what i said   we are here to help you
look at me pinocchio you can trust me
you are real the only true person i trust is my father
i like the way you dance couldn't even recognize us properly
i am sabina
i am pinocchio
thanks for saving my stuffy nose
you know what they say   the show must go on
 you are a great girl  thank you
it is a big crime to meet us in this mess
mr stromboli said i can go home and tell my father i'm popular
but he stuck me
ah
is that why you don't trust anyone  
i trust you in a way
thank you i will try to give it a value
do you see that hanging key  
that is the key to the cage
we have to get it anyway you have to escape from here
but it will get you into trouble
can i trust you with anything pinocchio  
when we go to the next village we are puppets and handlers
stromboli takes back the stolen money and escapes
 escape    yes escaping
then we start our own show
then we can treat everyone with kindness like family
what's going on here  
pinocchio my little pinocchio
are you ok you need to get some rest
tomorrow we have a big concert in siena
the people of siena love puppets they will give us a lot of money
i checked to make sure there was no other work
except on stage there is a lot of work there
i think so much this is how it ends
starving inside a pickle bottle i thought to live 103 years
of course this should not have happened
if i had not touched this conscience work
look at this
i can't imagine if pinocchio had a chance
pinocchio hey pinocchio here this is jiminy
i can't even believe it we are so close yet so far
wow
ok i will take care
sh pinocchio pinocchio listen to this
jiminy nice to see you too stromboli trapped me in this cage
well locked pinnock i don't think this is what you expected
when you decide to be a famous actor right  
this is not my fault i never wanted to be famous
sorry kids as far as i remember it didn't
but i didn't want to be popular i wanted to go to school
 hey  that's true
all these people cheered and clapped i don't like it
 wow  what's going on jiminy  
it looks like an illusion of a goddess
i'm in your nose
but a lie can change someone's life pinocchio
that's why i'm telling you
110% honestly honest just the real truth
believe me
oops ok the last part is not true but everything else is true
jiminy are you okay  
to a great extent now stop lying
jiminy do you see that key  
ahha i can see
that is the key to this nest can you get it
no time i can't go near it
hey jiminy do you want to know something  
i don't want to be a real boy
come on
wow
jiminy are you okay  
yes but tell me is it a true lie or a false lie  
it is definitely not a lie i wanted to get the key
i'm sorry jimin
pinnock remember what the blue angel said  
it doesn't matter what you make on the outside
truth is within the heart that is what being true is all about
but thanks for your apology
jiminy i'm sorry i didn't hear what you said earlier
ok
thanks pinnock now swing me to the lock
a little more ok
ahha
hotdog we did it
those are hotdogs what is that  
no time to teach you about parables my friend
 let's take you home now  okay
i met good people jiminy
they helped me even when they didn't want to
that's what friends do
one of them is a puppet like me her name is sabina
is that so a puppet friend like an equal
are equals friends  
not forever pinnock
you have to be careful because sometimes in a group of likeminded people
they like to pressure
jiminy   where did he go
come on
blimey here's what we found on the road
a little wooden boy
look at him he is made of wood
i am lampwick what is your name lee putura  
 my name is pinocchio  pinocchio  
 pinocchiowho    pinocchio
what's your story lee patura   why are you made of wood  
because i'm a puppet but i can be a real boy
i must say as a puppet you are very talented
only smart young guys know about the collection
collection   what collection
collection done to the island fools
all you had to do was stand in the dark on a deserted road
you were on edge so you pulled yourself together
ok but i need to find my conscience
conscience  
why is it funny  
you your conscience is the last thing
take you to happy island
happy island   are we going there  
you know sweet potato we're going there
it is the best fun ocean in the world no police no parents no laws
you can smash it and nobody will say anything
did i hear correctly  
do you want to change evolve then say  
yes
it is a great fortune that you come with us
because happy island
you can have a lifechanging experience
you will no longer be a puppet that's for sure
really  
yes in the name of god ready to die
so mr driver that sounds like fun
but i don't trust you
what
 come on  what  
children it seems there is a doubter among us
there is a mouse who does not believe in fun
i mean who doesn't believe in a lifechanging experience  
shall we change course and go back to mommy and daddy  
do not
then you go i will come another time
i'm very sorry it doesn't work that way
this fun is only for the clansmen if you are not a clansman
if you cannot be like these children there is nothing here for you
don't believe me do them
the time has come and don't run away
sink or swim or die
are you coming with us on this trip   decide now
don't be a party animal and don't be afraid to have fun
this is for you and all of us
don't drop the ball after the game starts
if you lose everyone is doomed
yes
 real kids always want more  always want more
real girls are always like real boys
about a conscience reading nonsense
you don't need it anymore
what a joke
time to play the game
all your worries will melt away
time to play the game
now it's time to play
so tell me what you think
ok then
i mean we all
let's go
ok
ok then to happy island
ok
wow
pinocchio don't
welcome to happy island
come in
 enjoy the journey  come and get on the boat come on
there's a lot to enjoy here keep smiling
there is no one to say no
look at that a log
wow
 beer  beer
 look at that free beer  beer
here you go gentlemen get a tall one these are free
if you take two more at the same time
lots of beer
yes free beer for life
i know look at the pile of beer
give me that beer
this kid is crazy
come on
wow
hey
woohoo
wow
well done pinnock
wow
look at these kids
they take everything there
give me that
push
hey wood
wow
that idiot's got a fire under him that's for sure
i like them
hey let's get back here and break some clocks
they are like my father's watches
really   watch this
right in the middle
 it's your turn  do not thank you
as someone tells me if my father finds out i'm here he won't be happy
reading nonsense stories is about a conscience
you won't need it again
so play
time to play the game
it was my mistake to send him to school like a real boy
shouldn't have done that never what the hell
ah sophia is this you   what  
what does that mean   happy island happy island  
is pinocchio here  
god this is a terrible crime
a great disaster
ah
now we are talking am i good or not  
this is strangely quiet
where do you think all the kids went lampy  
they must be here somewhere why you ask
they are some losers four corners
look at that
another great shot as i said
haha where did everyone go  
what kind of curse is this  
ah come on
something is wrong with the table this seems like a drag
okay wood your turn
hey lee pathura i had something to ask you
why didn't you break any of those screaming clocks  
any guy in the real world would love to break them
it didn't feel right
hear what the twoshoes man said
i don't think you're a thief yet
i don't want to be a thief i want to be a real boy
the way you go you'll be a halfreal boy
looks like you still have a conscience
if i still had a conscience
pinocchio
what are these donkeys doing  
oh my god
apparently i fell into a donkey barn
let's take these fools
if you get these donkeys to the salt mine quickly you will get paid quickly
i still say it's wrong to shout when someone is about to strike
forget it
everyone knows that a trick is to mentally wear down the opponent
you have to do everything to win
you're wrong lampy i still say you committed theft
i hear you talking
you think we're going to be in trouble
conscience right  
what an old man
ah lampy you better take a look
why do i look like you   as a fool  
you must
hey you sound like an ass
did that come from my mouth  
haha
help
someone help fooled me i was cheated
help please someone
someone please talk to someone help please
mother mother
what's up   what am i doing
help help jiminy jiminy
jiminy jiminy
pinnock let's get out of here
kids they're being asses
come on you too
these mischievous people
that wooden boy catch it
wow
jiminy let's go
something you say pinnock let's get out of here quickly
there they go
out loud don't let them escape into the sea
wow
we are trapped
not not like that positive thinking jiminy
let's go
a bollocks a wooden donkey is worth quite a lot
someone poured a barrel of salt into the water
you are in the sea pinoc sea water tastes salty
 now swim swim with those hands  like this  
that's right pinnock now you can let's escape from here
 we can't catch monstro  who is monstro  
a sea monster he sleeps on the water of the sea
very big like an island
father   this is me pinocchio i am home
maybe he is sleeping
see
all his watches are gone
what do you think happened to him  
he went to sea
 he went to sea    he went to sea  
that's right went to the sea am i not speaking clearly  
 how is sophia    how do you think   by boat
he wanted to go to happy island to find pinocchio
he sold all the watches and bought a boat
those watches are his everything all his life work
did he sell them to find me  
that's right children
you are his everything more than watches
more than anything
let's go
i don't see gepetto
well i could be wrong but it looks like stromboli
quickly under the jetty
see that's sophia
i got an idea i will go to the sea and see if he knows the direction gepetto went
you hide
pinocchio
sabina   it's great that you came
see you have new ears
yes another tail
pinocchio we members of the new marionette family theater
there is a good proposal to be made
 have you started a new show    definitely
last night stromboli was arrested and jailed
wow
new marionette family theater i like that
but there is more we would be honored if you join our show
really   will you guys take me to the show  
yes with both donkey ears
and we want to make you the main actor
really   i can't imagine anything more beautiful
but
i want to find my father
pinocchio i think your decision is right
definitely pinnock i'm proud of you
and look the donkey's ears are gone
yes my donkey's ears are gone
your tail too
they are both gone
we have to go now
maybe we'll see you next year in siena right  
i think so too
until next year
and pinocchio tell me you remembered your father
me too
 when he was found  when you find him
definitely
my goodness i forget
sofia said geppetto had gone south two hours ago
he agreed to take us from the sky until we find him
just wait
let's talk about one thing mr raheiya
i said i'd take you over i can't lift this heavy wood
don't worry child
 what are we doing    i have an idea
no boat in sight i can only see water
we will find him positive thinking
what pinocchio what does he say  
yes i heard it but what are you
sophia   do you see anything
yes yes
i see a small boat
 a small boat    yes a dinghy
 what is a dinghy    a small boat
gepetto i can see gepetto
gelato he sees his father
gepetto that's gepetto
father this is me pinocchio
father
dad it's me pinocchio
dad it's me
did you hear anything figaro  
i'm stupid i thought i heard pinocchio
it's like i'm daydreaming
father this is me pinocchio
father
pinocchio   running on water  
this is a miracle pinocchio
pinocchio you came
that's dad i'm coming to you
no wait i'm coming to you
it's a miracle look at this did you see cleo  
cleo figaro look he can also run in water
he can definitely run in water he is made of wood pinocchio
dad i'm sorry i didn't come home straight away after i was dropped off at school
did you get kicked out of school  
yes because of a puppet
so i went to a puppet show to become popular
are you popular  
very popular
i danced in a puppet show and earned a lot of money
but then i was kidnapped and locked in a bird cage
so i had to tell a lot of lies to jimin and stick my nose out and run away
but i was caught a driver of a cart with silly children
then taken to happy island
there i learned to drink i don't remember their name
but happy island is a bad place because i got two donkey ears
there came after me some steam beasts intending to sell me to the salt mines
but jiminy helped me we jumped off a mountain and swam to the sea to the beach
then we came to know that you sold all the watches and bought a boat
that he went looking for me
now here we are
did you do all that in one day  
yes
my god i have not done even a part of that work in my lifetime
sorry dad i apologize for the trouble i caused
oh pinocchio my child everything was forgiven
i'm glad to see you taking care
now we can go back home and we can be together
we are very happy
monstro that's monstro
i see he is sleeping
get up inside my friends open your big mouth
father father
pinocchio pinocchio did you swallow too  
father father
here catch it
oops i hit my wood boy with a piece of wood
 ah pinocchio pinocchio  hello dad
pinocchio pinocchio nice to see you
nice to see my boy too
figaro you are here too klioth
yes yes we are all together isn't it great  
still being inside a whale's belly is strange isn't it  
but let's do something it's a little wet inside isn't it  
dad your boat still floats
yes yes it's a very nice boat
once monstro opens his mouth we can ride out
i don't know that pinocchio look at this pile of garbage
as i see it not everything that comes in goes out
but it might go the other way it is not a good choice
 dad what's inside that lantern    whale oil
that's right i have an idea
now
we did it dad look at the smoke
that's great i think
come on dad let's move the boat to the right place
open up i want to go inside said to open
the door is open
look what i know
wow wow
no no no no
no no no no
look dad
ah ah ah
i think he is about to get angry because of the smoke
because of that he must be scratching his insides
pinnock pinnock
jiminy grab it
 jiminy   who is jiminy    my conscience
is this wrong your conscience  
i am let me tell you it's not an easy task
get ready dad
pinocchio

your dreams come true
pinocchio my boy are you there  
that's dad i'm here all of us
ah
cleo   figaro  
figaro cleo you all are here
i had a strange dream
i saw in a dream that we were all swallowed by a whale
that's dad but not for long it's a sea monster we all came out
ah
yes yes here we come now i remember you saved us
you swam faster than a normal boat
no real boy can do that
ah pinocchio thou hast truly tried thy heart
that makes you a true boy
know what else you have   selfless very very brave
pinocchio when you first came to me
i probably thought i wanted someone else
but i wished for you too
you will always be my true boy
not a single thing should change from you
i am very proud of you
i love you so much
i love you too dad
we have a long way to go don't we son  
definitely dad now let's go home
yes let's go home
come cleo figaro but
pinocchio
do you know the way
let's go after that
so finally
pinocchio proved that he is brave honest and not selfish
since then many stories have been told about him
people say that he has changed into an honest good and true boy
did it really happen   who knows but i know one thing for sure
from his heart
pinocchio is too real for any real child to be

thousands of kids complain that their bbots don't do this

maybe the person who writes computer programs to make friends
not fit to control a big tech company
hmm
ok here is our story
we leave everything to chaos bots
the only bot that had a small code problem
little   but sad
what's the trouble   let's go to the internet
delete all videos every post
every tv channel that broadcasts it
let's buy it and replace it with cat videos
then we can put the blame on the children
if no contract is signed
send some fruit to the principal
but what does the intellectual think  
ok andrew you do this
a trifle
hey run back to the lab
find something that won't kill us

another thing i behaved like a madman in front of the master of the palace
 are you acting out again    may be
but for my part his chief servant is very airy
just then the lord came and saved the day
did i mention he's handsome  
servant or master  
master walt
think about it he's like 100 years old but our age
wait
wait a second
 hi  hi walt
sorry for bothering you late i saw the lights on under the door

i wanted to apologize again
our servant he's old fashioned
i don't think you were embarrassed
they really are
i'm very sorry

i don't know if it's possible

more times than you think
i don't understand how that happens
a happy life has its downsides
are there wolves in england  
americans wolves  
there hasn't been a wolf in 400 years
knowledge or nakedness   what could it be evie  
is this from the 17th century  
great 1632
this is beautiful
what is that building  
ice house an old time thing
before the advent of refrigerators
but i have something better to show
is this yours
but none of us can
want to rotate this  
 in this dress    no problem i will get a new one
sorry i know it's confusing
no problem i understand you are the richest
ok
so why did you turn to this  
ceramics
sorry pagan goods
my mother it is his hobby
when i was little he taught me how to use pots cups
making stupid clay sculptures
he must have known before that you will grow up to be an artist
i don't use the word artist
but i think you're right
now he is gone
because of this he is close
how are your parents
they they are not among us
it
that was a long long time ago
look at us
two orphans
if dicken was there he would write a story
 i don't like the way he writes  ah why
i have zero happy qualities
stop being one way
what way what kind of way are you talking about  
mysterious selfcontradictory
the bad guy who says i have nothing to do i have plenty of money
it's an act i can tell
really   how do you say that  
first of all didn't read about your full assets
 a big win  you will be surprised
also you apologized to me without thinking about the situation
that's a big thing
i did it in an attempt to win your heart
anyway are you showing me these to torture me or  
yes not what are you saying
i can't imagine how
when you wake up in the morning everything is always at your fingertips
maybe you should think about it
when will you stop saying things like that  
when will you kiss me
why do you think i'm cheating on you  
now that's a common trick
would you like to stop them  
thank you for coming
thank you
did you turn the girl into a pumpkin  
he relieves fatigue while traveling
looks like you had fun
he is very fresh
is everything shiny new  
great
always
i really mean it
ev
hey it's me right  
there was something here
 what    here
where is  
there is nothing here
not but
hey
hey hey hey
no problem
everything is fine look at me you be careful
 okay  come here
you don't have to do that i messed this up too
this is my job miss you can't leave your room like this
come on sorry
don't think that
i feel like i'm going crazy
thank you ms swift
thank you i'll stay here and take care
ok sir
how are you now
 like a fool  do not
right   this is a new environment it takes time to get used to
if you like i'll stay with you until bedtime
yes that's good
 thank you  okay
do you have a favorite side  
why
pull i usually fall on all fours
any side
ok
i mean like it
ok
 we  okay
talk to me
it makes me sleepy
i'm actually a little curious
but i don't know how to ask
ok it's a bit more straightforward
you are lying in my bed
i wonder what do you want with your life  
 we're going there  yes
i'm not used to small talk
i noticed
ok i have to say i like to work as an artist
say something important everything
but really i sell water
is in trouble
i want life to be complete
do you know throw risks into the sky
i really want it
good answer
what about you
what do you want in life  
i think about it a lot
i can tell
i have a good life i know that
but you know something  
having all the money in the world makes no sense
you know that's what rich people usually say  
i know
i just
i want to share all this with someone who is experiencing these
i have this look
continue to present
yes it's a big life but
this is alone
i want someone who sees me as the real me
as an idea or concept that doesn't try to change me
or they can whip it into a cough
someone accept me
you look so peaceful i didn't want to wake you up see you tonight walt
hello sleeping princess
what time is it now  
time for our spa day
we have prepared more happy day for the women of this party
we heard it was a great evening
yes don't worry about it
it took me a while to get used to this old stone bungalow
leave it there there is no signal in the direction we are going
come on
ok
spa day
[grace] eev hello           i'm calling the police [ev] i'm fine don't worry
this is ev
sit down calm down
hello
i am looking forward to seeing the bride and groom today
yes they fit well
 do you want to get married one day    my goodness
i don't know
i still look young
but what if you meet the right one  
age is a number
maybe one day but i like my freedom
is it
do you have brothers and sisters
not my parents have one
if they can they will ask for money back for the rest
not i don't think so
that's a joke
ok definitely
i have brothers but
always wanted a sister
leave the poor girl alone lucy
you look like a little pomeranian
i also love a sister
sounds like you and walter together evie
we know each other
you don't have to lie to me but i'm curious
what did he say about us  
nothing
but i'm sure if he has something to say he will tell me
i am sure he will tell everything at the right time
how can you know someone well without knowing their past  
i think people should be accepted as such
people change there is no point in looking for bones
i'm talking nonsense
no one is so virtuous
whenever we get a chance we all look for gossip
looking at their diaries messages emails
there is nothing to do that's how we are
i think we'll agree to disagree for now
then you are not curious at all
what happens behind locked doors  
what is your problem
sorry miss
 i'm so sorry  no it doesn't matter
evie you're bleeding
 i'm fine no problem  poor girl
let me see
what   what the hell is wrong with you
 evie i'll come with you  no problem see you later
i was just kidding doll learn
you love me i promise
shik
eevee  
are you ok
i leave
why   did victoria say something  
i don't care about victoria
ok i can describe this
 did you find my information    it's a small effort
on your desk there is a file with my name on it
let me tell you
i knew this couldn't be true here is the evidence
 evidence for what    you said
want to know about me but everything is here
my mother's name where i grew up my school you know everything
don't jump to decisions
do you do this to everyone who comes here or just to people like me  
this has nothing to do with it
smart thinking reading my criminal record
also i had my cysts removed when i was 13
it would be better if you add it to your details
 you are very stubborn  you are very arrogant
you don't know people use you
how to take advantage always
really   i don't know how it is  
i wanted to know a little about you before letting me sleep over
don't you do the same  
when oliver asked if he should invite his longlost sisterinlaw to the wedding
i asked if i could send you some information about you
make sure you are not an opportunist
this is not the first time
i hate technology and he knows it so printed a few pages and sent them to me
this is it
i wanted to know about you
the truth is about you not the little things written on paper
and yes i'd be lying if i said i wasn't intrigued by what i saw
i am guilty of that
you should have asked me
i know i'm sorry
i made a mistake
i just
i am not used to these
i didn't expect you to be like this
i didn't expect you either
 did we have our first fight    don't go too high
do you think you are the only one who is afraid of getting hurt  
 oh nothing can scare you  really  
i was scared when i saw you unpacking
please don't run away
ok
no more secrets
we have to prepare for dinner training
is it time now  
i'm thinking
i can't wait to see the wedding of the century
we have two weddings
 what a joke  why not  
why not get a quick marriage  
 yes  my goodness
i mean our family is here everything is prepared
both of us are good together
we have to live in the moment throw away the risk
ok i like
i left a dress for you in the closet if you need something to wear
more gifts  
walt
you know i was joking right  
here he comes
darling sit down here the festival is about to begin
ok
one must accept the part
my dear friend
my brothers
i would like to properly welcome the three families to new carfax
the wellingtons of whitby
klopstocks in budapest
alexanders of london
 let the party begin  ok ok
you are a vision
it's very intense
you know about the english and customs
i'm so glad we finally got to be honest with each other
me too
so where are the bride and groom  
more if you all allow
our four families helped each other for generations
but as everyone knows
there was always someone missing from this table
one of the most important people in our alliance
we all felt the stress of inequality
but today the bond once broken is renewed
getting stronger again
when evelyn alexander and i got married
best wishes
what are you doing walt
 food and drink please  walt walt
by the end i was horribly bored
lord
for as long as i can remember
dear people gave me
brides as gifts
three bridesmaids
three maya no
for that you and your family are protected
and prosper
generations
we are at our strongest with three
when we have three people we can improve
emmeline alexander's bride when you try to leave us
our collection got interrupted
emmeline my alexander bride
in 1925 your grandmother's mother emeline
 your grandmother's mother  who is that  
the former lady of this palace
he recently disappeared
tonight we celebrate our eternal bond
in the collections made by your ancestors eons ago
raise a glass
for evie
 my new bride  for evie
you brought us a new life
to these four walls
maybe this old heart will have to revive again
be happy fellow brides
happy brides
i think congratulations must be given to my dear brotherinlaw
i want to go
i want
please let me go
i am begging
ev
my love what's wrong  
i want to go home
but this is your home
we are your family
evie i thought we agreed to stop this game
secrets
we are now free to be real
no  
why are you just sitting around  
do something help me
 you are all demons everyone  miss
you are sick
don't think too much of his words you know how brides are
help
help me
you're embarrassing me
hey
hey hey hey hey this is me
do not
prepare him tonight is yours
tomorrow is mine
welcome our new bride to the family
to eat come and eat
welcome to the bachelorette party eve (bachelorette party)
hey no no no
don't cry
we will soon be like sisters the three best dolls for the master
 please let me go  enough now
your grandmother's mother didn't have such a hard time either
until he says he can't feed himself from the helpers
a selfish act
he got us all in trouble
emmeline is lovely
we became very good friends he until he was confused
but you
you're not messing with us are you evie  
that one
my room isn't that you  
sorry i was in the mood to play
why  
why are you doing this to me  
for your blood of course
our bloodline is rare
they are special
by their combination we become fourfold
time is not valid for us
look we were both in the same situation as you evie
at that time women were restricted from making decisions
victoria has been with him for 500 years
i'm still a grandfather
in ceremony you are confined to the master
more for us
but to make that bond permanent you must first drink his blood
when you drink you draw his power
you will have the strength of a hundred men
but after the master drinks your blood
we have eternal life
as long as he lives your power will be with you
do not
no no no
no no no
do you like him
d
clean him up save this for the event
a new wife is appointed
look at eevee
your new home
 please don't let me in  no no no don't worry
you can come out in the afternoon
there are many misconceptions about our nation
please
 say good night  no no no no stop it
help
no no no
do not stop it
no don't leave me
do not
do not
no help
help
shik
soon now
don't make noise
wait
 dia  you go and send help
why are you helping me  
your grandmother's mother is a dear friend of mine
he held on as long as he could for everyone
but in the end she couldn't bear marriage to a demon
go quickly
if you see someone you can kill them with a spike cut throat or fire
don't stop running until you get out of england
what is happening to you

a nickname i really like

eevee eevee eevee think about what you will get
wealth power
great strength eternal life
no diseases like your mother
no difficulties no longer limited by human existence
a life of privilege
a sense of belonging
a family just for you
isn't that what you came here for  
isn't that what you want  
someone is yours
behind
this is definitely not a small thing
this will make your life much easier
if you come willingly
nothing to say no matter what you say you already accepted my offer
you tricked me
luckily for me no more details
sorry
in my opinion this leg bone is underrated
do not laugh
i'm so glad you're back to your senses honey
we are together this evening
purify this collection of our gracious lord and
of his new bride
alexander bloodline
long live
happy brides and grooms
lord
will you accept this woman as your bride  
i like
and you evelyn alexander
do you give love respect
mission and obedience every day of your eternal life  
everything will end here
with me

you take his power
 gaining power
yes
now exchange blood
hello honey

you are miserable
you are not one of us

you are useless
what do you think you're doing  
this is victoria please
come to your senses
can't
can't
can't
you can no longer command me
i said to the master when you say you are lowly
that you don't fit our situation
i had to cut the baby's neck your grandfather's
when i got the chance
i have now cut your neck with passion
feeding the wolves
the kicker
i was trying to help you
save yourself from the causes of suffering
give you a family
status privilege
the power of the whole world
better to die than be a part of this
new generation women are very virtuous
every woman
you are a devil
i am a god
i think you guys will burn
you

it's either you or someone else
just like you
honey i think this is you
nice dress isn't it   i don't have one like this
god beth
don't do that
this is you right  
if this isn't you trust me
your husband's phone will get more extreme than you
just like you rather than fully clothed
ok i think he likes people like me
please owen loved you
he bowed down to you
i am
from what you've told me
you haven't given him a reason to stray
also how do you even know he took these pictures  
he can't tell the details now
a few of us are going to a small party today
all are from the department turn to clark
but you come too you can make up your mind
we will see
why are you looking through his phone  
shik
sorry
it's it's a silly question
an inappropriate story to tell
i'm very sorry
i don't think we had any secrets
everyone has secrets
don't let it go to your head
just
remember your owen
the one you loved
because whoever he was he loved
what is his name
maggie monroe
he is my best customer
he told me that i have no ability to teach
he knows
because he is an expert in many things
my goodness
do we read the book he gave us  
no time i don't want 300 pages
how to connect with my students
if they bother you stand on the table
change their lives
are you ok beth
do you believe in ghosts  
ah ghosts how  
i believe
 really    i don't believe it
i hope there is something in my house
like a soul
can't be
i don't know
i feel there is something
like someone is watching me
supernatural things like that
i see some dreams
they feel like dreams
but when they actually happen
like being stiff in a dream  
not
do you know what it is to be stiff in a dream  
they are gary i know what it is
i don't know
it means your mind is awake but your body is asleep right  
have you seen that documentary  
a friend of mine at school had it
it is very normal to feel like someone is with you
after a sensitive incident
like there are enemies
what about the other side  
like having a friend  
not your body wakes up but your mind doesn't
but isn't that sleepwalking  
ok sleep walking
is it contagious  
can't why  
owen walked in a dream
i remember that
it started a year or two after the house was built
are you doing it now  
yes
that's strange
how long have you been married  
ah
make up the numbers
fourteen years
if there was another one it would have been five years
wow
you got married at a young age
a little a little
you've spent a lot of time
together with the same person
then it feels like he is there
even if they are not there
but who knows right   i mean who's to say
what is happening to us  
what dreams come true when this mortal life is over  
until next time no shakespeare
are you really going to support my suicide  
the hell my goodness
my god i'm sorry
i was joking
just kidding
you don't joke about it
heather
ah
don't you really know there's a problem  
gary my goodness
i don't mind
not i didn't know
i was stuck in those things depression
dark ideas
he was the one who had done them in one place
maybe they went to him
i don't know maybe he caught my antics
no no
 it won't happen  no  
didn't he have a letter  
ok
 i'm very sorry  he wants to talk about it
i think we have talked about this
he did so
beth
he had a letter
my goodness
do you keep it in your purse  
ok
you are right
there is nothing like that
nothing is behind you
you're careful now
that is all
is that all  
that is all
not even your dear husband  
nothing
what does it mean  
no clue
except i lived with a crazy man
and i didn't know
you were surprised by that right  
what else do i not know  
i want to know
ok i think it's time for you to go home
ok i mean he's not good at waiting
ok
let's go
ok let's go
good night thank you

i lied
about the letter
modi my goodness
my god you got us i thought it was true

that's true
i lied when i said i had no idea about it
you know
i died in tennessee have i told that story  
hmmm
it's seventeen in high school
a friend drove
the vehicle fell down a hill
i was shocked
the lungs were crushed they picked me up
the heart stopped completely four minutes
my goodness
after that everyone who heard about the incident asked
what was it like   what did you see  
i didn't want to disappoint them so i said
i don't know i don't remember
but i remember
i only meant owen
there is nothing there
what are you saying nothing  
if i could tell you something
about a light at the end of a cave
there was only a cave
there was barely any relief owen never understood
we agreed on many things but not this one
about things after death he believed in a good place
he tried to make me believe it too
but you can't lose what you know
you're right there's nothing there
there is nothing after you
you be careful now
he said i am right
now i'm not sure either
he said you should be careful what to watch out for  
i guess we'll never know right claire
do you really believe in ghosts  
not i was thinking about you
hmm
you are very good
shouldn't i be here today  
wait until i fall asleep

what are you looking for
a house
 a house    hmmmmm
there are no houses here this is a government reserve
it is forbidden to make it
ok i told a stupid story
i thought i saw something last night like
like a light from a light bulb through a window
a house  
hmmm
anyway this gives me a good ventilation
if you don't mind
in a way there is a problem
sorry what
you're not well beth
you've had a lot going on these days
take my mind off it if you don't mind
i wish you weren't walking in this jungle alone
you should be with friends and relatives
do you have someone

 i'll make a sandwich  hmmmmm
that's a good idea
give me some more time right  
is there anyone
mel  
mel  
wait
ok
 what the hell is this    what  
what the hell is this
how do i know  
kehelmala you tried to keep me away from the forest
because i worry about you
 what is he doing    what  
there is a house there in our house my house
now what the hell was he doing there  
i don't know i haven't seen a house
i have seen him walking around here
again and again late at night
what why didn't you tell me  
he said not to say
mel
this is beth
i don't think you can handle this now
ah
tell me everything you know
i caught him once
like meeting you this morning
the same way you went around the lake
there was a woman with him
i thought it was you so i spoke and when he turned
you're not
not
he came that night
knocked on my door it's night
very badly
he was very drunk mud was all over his clothes as if he had fallen
now i know what it's like
but i believed everything he said
so   what did he say  
that he has desires
shameful desires
he is very ashamed of what he does
said he found a way to stop it
what kind of desires  
i'm sorry i didn't mean to ask
see don't think i didn't bet with this one right  
i swear by shelley
i never saw anything like that again
i wanted to tell you that so many times
but he was fine after that
you were both fine
i think you are wrong
he left a void in your life
you have to think about filling it this is it
this is
what can i say if i may say something
don't fill your mind with bad and dark things
you are closer to death than ever
but that is not true
the wayfinding puzzle
lies and deception
after choosing a few mantras the object is ready to be given
dark souls are weakened and entangled by simple riddles and retrogrades
this book was sold by books and melody company
this book was sold by books and melody company
book and melody company
ok
come back
come back
just wait
i didn't really come to buy these a little problem
my husband bought these from you
i thought you could tell
did he take anything else  
or even if he was looking for something
we do not report such things
ok can you even say when  
when were these taken  
is it written near you  
 not like that  okay
can you tell me the other books of this author  
ss
give it a try
this is dyson
you probably want sturgis but
hi
hi
do you work here
yes need some help  
hmmm
i'm beth
beth patchin
madeleine
i think you know my husband
 i don't know  owen owen patchin
he had pictures of you on his phone
jonah  
it doesn't matter no need to ask for help
i don't do anything
i mean
problem solved now
i guess
 ah  yes
he is dead
what
killed himself
oh my god
if you have to go somewhere suddenly
hmmm
 nothing like that  ah
so can i tell you what it's like  
ok hmm
he came here several times every year
he is very friendly
we chatted a bit and then he came here often
we had a few drinks that's all
cut your hair
 what    your hair the ponytail
take off break it
why  
because you slept with my husband and i'm asking nicely
i'm not like that
i didn't sleep with him
honestly i don't even know him very well
centuries stories
he said he didn't even know owen well
what did you say
it's the same i said me too
do you trust him  
what did they not sleep  
yes
sure
that's one thing
not a good thing
i mean it makes sense if you slept
there are others my neighbors have seen him with someone else
really  
yes i looked at his computer
it had tons of pictures
about half a dozen women
they all look a little like me but not a lot
then he didn't sleep with them
what the hell have you done  
i had a dream the other day
it's our home but it's not
it was on the other side
i saw him with someone else…
stop
stop stirring up his stuff
you won't find anything that will help you now
not clear what i'm saying   he had a secret life
are you going to lecture me now  
what about his privacy rights  
i understand these things happen to you
but i'm worried about you
maybe step back a bit
i do not know
i feel him
i feel my husband
you're right there's nothing there
why does he say nothing   he didn't believe it
beliefs change
look at you
you're the most suspicious person i know
you say now your house is haunted
i mean if you think about it that way
it's a silly story
don't go home
stay away from the lake for a while
you can stay here
you can stay as long as you like
it's not over
there is no end to everything
you will never know what he was thinking
he's gone there you are
you still have a life
not you are right
i can be a little distant
i'll go and pack some things i'll get a bag
i will take a room for a few days
 i don't understand what you really mean  really
also you made some good points really
i love you
talk to me right  
ok
i leave
tonight
so if you have something to say to me say it now
can you hear me
the thief
hey
sorry i didn't think you were home
i am home
i didn't think to come here
how do you know here  
i've been there before
i should have told you about this in the bookstore before
but honestly you scared me
sorry about that
not i understand that
i am likely to do the same
it's really cool
when i finish work and take a nap
i saw this dream
i dreamed like you
i am myself but i am you
something is chasing you and it's all around you
of our
but did it catch us  
i'm not sure i woke up there
after that i couldn't stop thinking about you
i thought there were things you should know
 things that happened  wow
i said i didn't sleep with your husband
you can call him by name he is not my husband to you
ok
i really mean it
i didn't sleep with him
but it could have been done i thought we but
he came one evening
when i finish work
he invited me here like a little ride
usually i don't go
but he is smart good…
i do not know i just wanted to be careful with him do you know
know
ok
so he brought me here
we had a few drinks
walked along the lake he showed me the other house too…
wait did you see that
there was nothing to see in it but he was very proud of it
i mean nonsense mostly
i was shown room by room
then he showed me a strange image said to catch it
did you do it
what exactly did he do to you  
nothing
he caught me
in one way
he put his chin on my shoulder
i know it's awkward to talk about
but at that time
that sounds like a very good thing
being close to someone
the feeling of being there
i am
i felt him tremble
he cried a little i didn't know what to do
what did he do to you
i love him he took me back too
it was very lovely at first
so i
when he put his hand on my back i didn't want to stop
but i didn't stop when he put his hands on my neck
until he shook his hand
my goodness
maybe i'm misunderstanding you know   i am
the way of loving each other is different
did he bully you  
god no
i asked him to stop he stopped
but did you think he would stop  
but he stopped
he took me home
he said it was his fault not mine
he was tired and worried
didn't know who he was
it was no longer carried out
he was afraid he wouldn't be able to stop
stop what  
i don't know exactly
but in the end
he said he knew what to do
he better stop it
see
i wanted to tell you
he was clearly upset about cheating on you
he talked about that didn't he  
we need to talk
i won't leave until we talk
you called me and i came
don't you want to talk to me  
you called him
i am here i'm still here
wherever you are

hello  
look into my eyes
i'm sure it is
stopping
ok i'm not saying that
having fun
ok my god
i really don't
not really
don't think about it
that guy has been around since we started
a fool
a subtitling in the zoomlk subtitles section
where are we  
my neck
 are you going the wrong way    where are we  
where are we  
i think in the wrong place
nothing
boss is this the right place  
an excursion bus overturned from the bridge
bodies found under the damaged bus
the windows were broken and belongings were thrown everywhere
from the damaged bus you can imagine what kind of terrible accident happened here
the bus overturned on a 21 meter cliff
it has been damaged
there are 36 passengers in it
the bus has fallen into the cliff
by breaking the protective embankments near the river
that's because the road is steep
you got up very early
do not be afraid
nothing happens
my child
i have a child in my belly
i know
it's a girl
that girl will have a brother
they will be twins
those twins will have many brothers and sisters
we do it
what are you saying
girl it looks like you don't know who you are
or are you acting  
it doesn't matter
you may not know
we are with you
where my aunt lives great
it is good
what is that
where did these come from  
that's what happens when you get to the old lady's house
senior manager
this view is very beautiful
how did you find this place  
i used to come and go here all the time
i could not have kept the loneliness without you for so long
you must have been busy with new work
it doesn't matter
i can't believe i drew so many pictures
did you draw all these yourself  
don't you want to do a solo show  
it is a crime to let things like this fade away
i heard that there was an accident in the lab
yes this morning
you will receive information directly
it's not like it's a headquarters issue
yes there was a problem
we had a little problem at the lab headquarters
not like that
it is not a small problem
sneak into the headquarters
telling you about these issues who are already retired
it doesn't seem right
but you are the one to watch
there are some other things you should know
who does this  
it's not related to the problem of the previous generation is it  
why you ask
looks like you still have the wrong taste boss
you are right
after this useless group destroys the lab it's scattered all over the place
boss aren't you interested in that  
who let those dolls go  
what is their purpose  
very few people in this foundation even know that this laboratory exists
there are only two parammapas that i can think of right now
organization of superhumans
and alliance
so it is not on our side
that's your side boss
right  
we need to do an investigation to find out about this right now
no no need
we don't have time to look into this situation
sneak into it
but as we see
it was done from within not from outside
what are you saying
yes
the child is gone
not abandoned lost  
yes the child is gone
he walked himself
it's over
what's wrong with you
where are you going

no matter how inexperienced i am
i've been a roadie for a while
when i was young these hands saved your father a lot
but why didn't you tell the police  
his injuries are strange
apparently he has a big story
that's why i'm more afraid to tell the police
that's true
dealing with the police is not very good for us
also it is difficult to describe them
i will take care of him until he gets better
ok do that

i don't like this house when are you going
dad didn't come until he died
what are you talking about  
do you know you're funny  
you said that you don't want to run away
he said that he did not want to see his father so he ran away
my father's land
since when do you think so much about your father  
since when was this your home  
this is my room since i was a child
you can stay in this
this
i'm thinking
try putting it on
put on comfortable clothes and go to bed
then rest
tell me if you need anything
that one
i couldn't thank you enough
thank you
thanks to you i survived
go and rest
take rest
the official name of this test is laboratory data report
it is simply written as adp
this could have taken more than 40 years
the core of this project is the children
that's what my sister and super humanitarians want
a complete one in this format
they were looking for it for a long time
separating the obvious genes
tried reset
this child is one of them
is koo jaeun still missing  
i know after leaving here
he came to the last lab last month
the boss let the children he met go
actually i was surprised
he is better than i thought
but jayoon was unpleasant here
so he was out of work for a while
he has a weakness
his brain works on drugs
he can't do much on his own
but this child is different isn't it  
i don't know what kind of monster he will be
it is always on the world
he should be fired
if the company becomes aware of this
the boss and i are both done
it will blow our heads
it was used as a headquarters for research
i know what you said
i hope that will clear my ten year old debt
then i go
they put a chip on the children in case of emergency
it can know the condition of their brain
there is still room
this will help you find him
but this doesn't seem to work
how do i use it  
do you know how to use this  
what
this looks broken
stop licking
that's shit
captain can we do this  
i mean
this is an unofficial operation he doesn't do it right
and it seems like something very important for the company
what the hell  
nothing
then go home
aren't you worried  
didn't you hear what the boss said  
also kids in the lab
i was there 10 years ago
they are fierce demons

let me go son
please son
son
father
is that your father's voice  
he is hungry
now what will you find when you make a noise  
they eat the whole village
the whole village ate
i was the last survivor
only the two of us are the last to survive
until yesterday there was also chunky aya but also him
he went
come with the police to the highway
i said not to go but giya
he thinks that chunky brother has sent you with the army to save us
but you can't save
what does he say  
he says that your father ate the whole village
unless he tells the whole story who started it  
who started it  
okal first his father ate
after
city police sir his grandfather
in big cities they ate everything
after that it became a habit for the townspeople to eat us
are there trains in the city  
where else are you  
if you survive you will stay there
there is a small village inside the big city
did that happen  
why don't you come to the city school to finish your studies  
so where else are you going  
why are they born in our city's hospital  
we don't have a hospital so we go to yours
don't read too much
there are mouths
yesterday's kirin is okal it's a little fried
if it has been stuck for three weeks how did the milk come yesterday  
there is a cow in the shed behind
when he gets a chance he brings it
don't they eat meat  
city people   yes the townspeople
they can taste human blood
why not eat him  
when he went to buy milk
it is difficult to catch him
if you do this you will feel less hungry
how do they eat people  
like that
i will bring some milk
don't be afraid okay  
remember this
it can only be seen if touched
if you talk you will see no no
now all three of us are going out
to the highway
from there calls and whatsapp are all fine
okal's father also said the same thing
okal's father also said the same thing why did he say it listen to what i have to say
okal's father also said the same thing what to ask
this is not a joke
this is kept safe for now
damn security
he likes to do these things
what to eat what not to eat
what they see what they don't see
bringing milk is just a reason
you know when he ate his mother and father
he opened his eyes and saw how he was eating
never trust him okal
he never tells the truth
are you in the city  
why didn't you eat him  
i saw my father eating
that day i came with it to this village
then i saw
since then i don't feel like eating anything
i don't mind
come on
the cow is dead
you have been hungry for weeks what should you do  
if he can go out why can't we  
you won't be able to survive
shut up
i give now
enough of this nonsense
leaving
the hell
this is how jobs are found
father ate
eat onions and drink spoiled milk
sister
where is this regional development office  
hello sister
don't delay
sir
something wrong is happening outside sir
sir the children are in danger sir
sir
sir
sir oh sir
what are you doing here  
oh wait don't leave us let's go insidelet's go inside
let's go in…let's go in…why
let's go in…let's go in…
put the roof on
is this a crazy village  
when i told anyone i was at a loss as to what was happening outside
who told   is there a school for the blind here  
the teacher was sitting here
ok
principal sir
here
in the village
some people in the village asked to be saved
said to escape
they will not eat those who have been eaten
first the eyes are blinded
can't hunt alone
it was on this same day that my father ate geography for the first time
then everything changed
why did you eat
his father is very angry because of that
so why did you eat geography sir  
this is not a place where a school can demonstrate
so why did your father say that if you want to stay in the village you have to get permission from the city  
father is a city councillor
don't you need his permission   your father
father
father please don't eat us
now we have to live like this
we are people
they are animals
we have a brain
they protect
listen
listen
you're a smart kid aren't you  
you know everything about them right  
what did he say  
why is that   if we move
can see
good
and then what  
if we talk
if you talk you will see
wellafter that
if you eat it
his recovery will come from us
maybe they think they ate us
they will not eat again those who have eaten
children
children
eat them
children
what happened to him  
hey
ate my children
who ate   who ate   ate
tell me what happened  
 calm down eat the children
where are your children atana atana
here here village
this village has been empty for a month
what happened to you   where did you go  
eat
build strengtheat
a special dish in town
and what are they doing in the village school  
i could have made a record
children fail a lot
the children will not fail there or else where else will they fail
the principal also comes to the school in our city
look at this
besides the syllabus also changed
the village was burnt
if you do something that burns you will burn
don't remember the village
the husband's daughter was lost and there was panic there
after becoming a councillor
don't you worry
nothing will happen to you you are safe
now you are with us
no one can touch you
love history  
the village once belonged to me
that village is like the capital of this entire state
indeed sir
now those days will return
karan johar
a lot of heart goes into this house
yes it's beautiful
my grandmother made this
so why an arranged marriage
i feel scared when i ask direct questions
why  
whatever the answer is it looks like a reason
okay then sorry for asking directly
i'm talking to you on social media
i found out from my facebook that you have many friends
i found out from instagram that you are very beautiful
you found out from twitter me
you seem to be right and smart
all that makes sense good
let me tell you there are a lot of bright people out there
they are stupid beyond the limits of their personal lives
i can tell
good joke
but
you know i am a difficult person to judge
explain more or run away
there's more to life please go
so my first boyfriend
let's say that he made his home in rihad
the second boyfriend promised me
sorry no it's okay
i was really confused
but he was ahead of me yes
the third lover is very much like you
do you like me
straight forward question
but now it's my turn
why an arranged marriage  
elaborate or run away  
oh
here's to you guys
we were about to send people to search
so
what is the verdict  
guilty
i don't know about you two but ira
i love your parents
they are very quiet people
i like quiet people
take as much time as you need
and it's a big decision
you can't claim to have drunk a cup of tea
for sure
so
love together
when the decision is made
all we have to ask for is grandmother's permission
not that where is grandma  
unfortunately he died 20 years ago
i'm very sorry
so how about permission…
i will speak
i will call him
after 4 months
iramishaoh my god
god

in three to four months the story is certain
did you work well  
good
not the worst
hashtag can go ahead
ok listen
i read your email
i was a little worried
i mean i am also a doctor
but a little strange
but talking to this dead grandmother is like a scary program
no it's not like that
durru loved his grandmother very much
she was almost like his security blanket
yes but he now has a sexy bed sheet
i think new relationships change old habits
i think he will eventually get over it yes
rip grandma
misha
today is your wedding
you act well
shanti mom the wedding was so beautiful right  
ira's sister was so beautiful
i was looking at him
me too
grandma always says never trust people with a sharp nose
sharp nose
does that mean sharp goals  
purposes
only the grandmother can tell us that
come on sleep
not exactly the music i expected
i listen to this poem when i am happy
is there anything else i should worry about  
i'm the only one
is this a single role or are you also playing the role of the bride  
era

is this one of the chairman's family  
it was like that before
the grave of his wife's family was also nearby but no one came after the house was moved
i am the only one who comes here from time to time
thank you for taking care of me
i will make one thing clear
i will decide whether to protect you or not after hearing the whole story
you should also thank the chairman
i did not even think that the warrant would be revoked
prosecutors have found evidence that could overturn the case
even this morning they have the ability to issue a new arrest warrant
get arrested   without killing anyone
prosecutors don't think so
 what do you think    i read your statement
there are many flaws let's hear from the beginning
how long has it been since you met kim se hee  
a year ago but all of that was stopped last winter
so why are you meeting him again  
that morning i received a threat
he demanded 1 billion won to reveal the affair
i didn't have that much money so i took everything i had
need a room  
room 514 please
your guest has already gone to room 514
i didn't know we were both the same threat
we waited in the room because we were told to stay in the room until they called again
 have you been there before with kim se hee    no
could it be because of what brought him to such a far place  
does it matter  
if he explains everything he can prove himself innocent
why didn't you tell the police  
i didn't want my wife to know that because i had stopped the relationship with se
did you think that everything would be lost if the affair came out  
i never thought so
keep saying it
we waited for about an hour
what's up  
there is something strange
get out
when he regained consciousness he heard a knock on the door
excuse me sir
are you in  
sir this is the police
please open the door
this is the police open the door
came because of a report is anyone in  
in se in se
se hi get up
help
help
in se
don't move
hands up
right now
slow down get out
get out soon
i'm not
 i didn't do this  get out
 stay still  i said no
 don't move  there was another one here
stay calm
don't move
there was another one here
there was another one here
according to the police report
at that time there was a maid outside room 514
but he did not see anyone coming out of the room
even if it is impossible and someone leaves it is impossible to get out after locking the door
then the only way out was through the window but that was also locked from the inside
i checked every possible place to get out but there was no trace
the police say that this was a murder in a closed room
if your evidence is true
has the criminal disappeared from the crime scene  
i don't know
 how it got inside is a mystery  must have been inside already
it was all a plan to make me the criminal
 who    i don't know
the police should arrest him
intelligence alone is not enough to make a good testimony
you have to be creative
there is no creativity in your testimony
what is the need for creativity when telling the truth  
according to your testimony you were the only one who saw the presence of a third person in the room
no matter who you are you become the criminal
lawyer
that's not me
i didn't do it
manager han seung yoon
hello  
are you sure  
ok
ok
got it
it is now clear what the new evidence of the prosecutor is
a former witness at the crime scene
how does that happen  
 you said a case of murder in a closed room  yes
there is no way there will be a witness to the murder case of kim sae
then this witness near the prosecutor is the witness in which case  
i don't understand what you are saying
there are two types of clients i meet
they are cooperative people who confess when asked to confess
or those who mistakenly think that they can be freed without a drop of blood on their hands
disappeared
if you don't know you should have seen it
it must be someone who knows because he quickly looked away
does the new witness have anything to do with the disappearance case  
if the lawyer does not know what the prosecutor knows the case is more likely to be lost
i need to know all this in order to reject the testimony of the witness
tell me
if you keep wasting time like this
prosecutors will quickly make arrests
disappeared
two months ago
ji yeon

after that  
after removing the car i met se hi again

a deer hit the brakes but now it won't start

 wait a little okay
i don't know because of my sister's car
on the left side there is a lever to go down
ah yes

because there are many electronics in cars they can be disabled with one problem
if there is no problem come to my place
after scanning the system should be fixed
or call a tow truck  
how long will it take  
 to the truck    no fix it
including the departure time it will take about an hour
so please help me with this
here it is
sehyun car center han young sok
aren't you from here   i don't belong here either
wife came to live here because she was ill
even after trying everything possible to do surgery and treatment
the treatment made the condition worse than the disease
but after coming here he got better
he started going back to work now
 that's a relief  yes
 yes producer    what about the video

i met my wife in a television company
wife is a local reporter i am the driver of that company van
even though he says driver i am like his manager
because i took care of clothes makeup food and everything at home
he said let's live together
he is someone who makes up his mind before five seconds if something happens
if she had not been sick she would have been the main news anchor now
scanning
look where
hey you woke up because of me
it's all over
oh wait a minute
 how many  no no
just consider it helpful
oh i couldn't give anything i will give you some chrysanthemum tea
no it's okay
don't go too long drink on the go
my son dried the flowers himself which is perfect for this weather
that boy took a job saying he could go to college anytime
he does not do that because his mother is ill and he wants to be near her
wifut will come home now and leave since dinner
give it a minute
oh min jun
yes how are you
best news reporter of the month lee hee jung
are mom and dad okay   say you remembered them
sung jae  
he had already left he left immediately
haven't you come yet   do not even answer the phone  
there is a stranger
ok i'll leave it then
this  
father
father
he forgot his phone
i have to go now
it's not
so what do we do now  
i have an idea
but i can't do it alone
he told me about his plan
i couldn't believe that he thought such a thing so quickly
it's like something you've been planning all your life
the look in those eyes scared me
we parted after promising that this would be the last time we would meet
finally we watch the prepared video
thank you very much for coming to the ha son art gallery opening
did you hear everything i said  
well done
anyway we succeeded
i was afraid that i would destroy it in a moment
what   want to get rid of the car at once  
it is near the old construction building it is difficult to find
why is that
a small accident no need to worry
other things   just the car  
do this help
if you want to remove it it is better to export it in pieces to keep a record
if used by a professional
there is no problem because their work is illegal anyway
i am your lawyer tell me if there is anything
focus only on the transaction
i couldn't focus on work but i couldn't take a break
the security software i made is ready to be exported to china
the fate of the company rested on it
take care of it so you can't find it
do not bother
there is a visitor from the police
that evening at around 540
han sun jae who went out to meet friends has disappeared
his car is missing along with him
after some time the boy's father came home
a broken down car was towed and repaired
he said it was a woman's
these are some of the parts found where the car was broken
they match han sun jae's missing car
the same place where his father had brought the woman's car
there are signs of another car hitting a rock
but surprisingly none of this has been reported to the police
so  
what do we have to do with an accident in gangwon  
the place where han sung jae's accident happened
he said he disappeared
so it cannot be said that it is him
where it is assumed that he had an accident
that woman was there and fit the place
the father of the missing boy remembered the plate number of the woman's car
when we checked that plate number we found that it belongs to this company
that's the car you drove
any employee can take the company car
as said earlier that car was stolen
he also told the police on his way back from busan
why did you go to busan that day  
there was a conference
more plate number
can't be sure he remembered exactly can he  
will it be possible to see the log records of the company car  
did it stop now  
or bring a warrant
don't want to find the stolen car  
the department of transportation will figure it out
don't contact my servicer without proof because it's out of jurisdiction
we are a bit busy now please go
we are young
the car was fine why worry so much about a small accident  
was in busan only on the first day
so on the second day  
with that woman  
then you will need an alibi (alibi – proof of being at the crime scene and not at the crime scene at the time of the crime)
what is the missing incident   are you related
 find me a truck  plate number  
only the type of truck and the driver's face are known
then it will take some time
what do you think the police will do  
as seen earlier i haven't even come close to contacting you
after giving such an alibi the police did not even contact him
i thought everything was over but that's when the real nightmare began
dad wants to go on a trip where are we going
any place is good for me so you decide
where are you going  
gangwon police has made the han sun jae missing case an open investigation
the police and local residents are searching together and
search operations are difficult due to the location of the mountains
haven't found it yet
the police speculate that this incident is not an ordinary disappearance
that's it
want more wine  
oh yes
are you crazy calling this number  
 did you see the news   what is going on    what  
why is this not a common case why am i the suspect  
what exactly did you say to the police  
even when there are signs of an accident
because no one reported it the police became suspicious
whose idea was car theft  
it's even weirder to just be there because the car is gone
then you should have told me first
what is this  
that man's purse was taken when he put it in the dickey
 what can i do with this    everything you need is in it
id card business card credit card
 do you think it can be done    do the work as best you can
that's your specialty
let's say the accident has nothing to do with it
but this is a crime
hiding the body
 isn't it a crime then    what  
don't feel safe just because her father didn't see you
i will not accept the mistake alone
never
seoul central district prosecutor's office
credit card transactions han sung j
financial transactions in suspicious accounts
i approached the phone fraud cases with the police
finding a financial case
made to be related to han sung jae's case
are you saying that everything was planned in se  
you don't know se hi
he is the kind of person who doesn't finish if he starts
the police have now turned han sang jae's missing case into a criminal investigation case
investigation of open criminal cases
a few days before disappearing
a missing person's case by an organization linked to phone scams
it was discovered that the money had been credited to the bank account
the police suspect this to be a planned disappearance
han sung jae's house was searched
after making the missing case a criminal case no one suspected us anymore
the transaction was completed successfully
i was also nominated as the it businessman of the year
received praise from many interviews
but it's all just a show
i felt sick inside
hello  
 attorney young    with me now
defense agreement signed  
no not yet
tell him everything and hand over the work to him
he has never lost a trial
be sure to sign the security agreement anyway
got it
another truck was found
is it   the driver  
there was only the truck and no one was home
 prosecutors are really quick  what does that mean  
the witness for the prosecutor may be the truck driver
the witness  
is the prosecutor's witness a witness  
lawyer young said so
give him some
wait a little
advocate jung
 hello    yes lawyer thanks for the help
ok
what is the story that the prosecutor has a witness  
still looking for more details who it is
 hello    hello  
hello  
it was cut
ok now you have all the trump cards
two incidents
two bodies
because the police only know about kim se hee's murder you become the only suspect
we can only know more if we know the case of han sang jae
to the third one who was hiding in the room
there must be a connection with han sung jae
did you say there was a threat  
sir
 sir this has arrived  who sent it  
the sender's name is not given
my silence is worth a billion won
if you tell someone about this without coming alone
will be revealed
mr yoo min ho i don't need to ask anymore
i understand why you couldn't tell anyone when you threatened about the affair
because they want to keep han sang jae's case a secret
answer one of these three questions and i'll believe it
one who called the police before you were attacked in the hotel  
this is the police
two why didn't the man who threatened take the money  
three how to get out of a locked room  
can't answer  
so it doesn't make sense to say that he threatened you because of the casual relationship
yours is not only lacking in creativity but also lacking in logic
so what's your argument  
did you say that both received the same threat  
yes but they only asked me for money
as i see this incident
there is something strange get out
wait a little
do you think his father was killed  
han young seok has that intention more than anyone else
what is that intention  
revenge
look at this
my son took the call before i met that woman
that woman brought the phone to my house
it is not proof that it was an accident
and that woman was not alone the man was there too
only the woman said what is the evidence  
said before he also changed the seat
he did not drive alone
i don't know because it's my sister's car
that is not the woman's car
 a car belonging to d&t security company  detective
please investigate this once okay  
han sung jae
sung jay
hey hurry up hurry up
 kick off  ok sir
there is a warrant to search your home
 start in his room  ok sir
what is going on  
your son may be involved in financial crimes
my son
honey
sung jay
the father who lost his child is now a monster
if the father can't even find the dead body when the son is accused
nothing he does will be lost
han young seok lost his faith in the police
he himself was ready to bring you to justice
my silence is worth a billion won
if you tell someone about this without coming alone
revealing your extramarital affair
he is not confident that he will never become a suspect
you never open your mouth about his son's case because he knows very well
he targeted that weakness
and he succeeded
you made everyone think that you her lover killed kim se hee
the three days of your interrogation
han young seok heard about your lawyer
 say something  mr yu
when your arrest warrant is revoked
he came to find me too
disappeared
you already knew what happened two months ago
now that we understand let's not waste time
but if that person does not know how he entered the room and how he left
everything goes to waste doesn't it  
han young seok knows everything about you but you know nothing about him
that is why the key of that locked room was not visible
these are photos of the crime scene taken by the police
the key was not inside the room it was outside
did this person get caught  
 no  definitely not
you never met han sun jae's mother
he started working again now
your guest is already in the room
need a second key  
the name is lee hee jung
he was in the front cabin of the hotel
do you understand now   why did they bring you to that hotel  
han young seok knew that both of you would take over the scene of the accident
when both of them came to the hotel half of the confession was done
everything else went according to plan
reserving the room next to the storage room is also part of the plan
he went up
han young seok was waiting for you two from inside the closet
lee hee jung reported to the police
han young seok planned the crime when the police arrived
we got a call
sorry
did something happen
a strange noise came from inside
he escaped from the room with the help of his wife
help
hands up
don't move
that's not me
 stay exposed  there was another one here
there was another one here
if you want to prove that you didn't kill kim se hee
han must contact young seok
then han sang jae's case has to be taken up
the most dangerous thing is bank hacking
i will never find out that i did it
good
you weren't in the car with kim se hee that day
according to the alibi he was in busan
kim se hee who drove your car
he faced the accident alone and overcame it alone
after that he stopped calling
so i become a victim of kim se hee
i didn't see him for two months until i met him at the hotel
that's where you first learned about han sung jae
if my car had an accident i could have told you
why didn't you tell me anything   what do i do now  
can it be done  
a dead person cannot talk
another piece of the puzzle is needed to prove that kim se hee did it alone
where is han sun jae's car  
but the truck driver saw me
it doesn't matter with the evidence now we can deny him
 the prosecutors will not sit idle in court  i guarantee this will not go to court
how is that  
there must have been evidence to prove that kim se hee and han sun jae were killed
then the only suspect kim se hee is dead so the prosecutors can't charge anyone
that's why no one can blame han sun jae's case
they just want to find something or dna belonging to kim se hee
but we need the car for that
is there no other way   prove that se hee did it
find one on your own
i'm getting suspicious of you now
when my client lied till the end to deceive me
 why am i lying to you    didn't tell any lies  
yes
you seem to like the story i made
but no matter how much you lie and hide it will come out in court
 isn't that true    only you know that
what if everything turns upside down  
upside down  
taking sun jay's purse
it was your idea to hack the bank account
if the person who wanted to break up was kim se hee  
sorry
the person driving
not kim se hee you
shall we go back to the beginning  
 hello    oh what did you say  
what time does it leave  
i will come as soon as work is over
 come soon i miss you  me too
it doesn't make any sense if you started all this  
 what are you doing    have to report
no one has seen anyone the journey has to continue
if we tell the police we're both done
come to mind
all this was led by you
if the person who tried to stop is kim se hee  
medical report
this is kim se hee's psychiatric report
after the accident he is very worried
he couldn't bear it anymore
the police say that this may not be a simple disappearance
they are awaiting conclusive evidence
and while the police are looking for one woman
this woman saw the father of the missing person
while driving a stolen car that day
the police have started investigations to find out if there is a connection with the disappearance of han sang jae
let's meet now and talk
i will come there
are you crazy   he told me not to talk again
why am i a suspect  
what exactly did you say to the police  
welcome
welcome
this is my son
in the end kim se hee made up his mind
even if he couldn't bring his son back to him at least do the right thing
hello  
kim se hee called han young seok
it was an accident
sun jay's mother
he has promised that he will definitely find his son's body
apologized
i will tell you where your son is
i'm very sorry
so why didn't han young seok report after se hee said  
it is impossible to prove a murder without a dead body
han young seok must know
you will never tell where the dead body is
and that you will always find a way to escape
he hoped that kim se hee would find the location of his son's body
but ms young
to tell the truth i had not completely lost consciousness at that time
i actually saw that man in the room
why didn't you say that earlier  
can i entrust my fate to a lawyer i met for the first time
i wanted to know
at least you are stable now
it's my job to be innocent but i can't do it if you lie
what lies
this photo confirms it
this woman and her husband planned to take revenge on me
why is there more evidence  
that person is not han sun jae's mother
just a hotel maid
i don't know who it is either
there was no third person in that room
you and kim se hee are the only ones left
at once i said about han sun jae's mother
are you lying about seeing han young seok in the room  
if you knew everything
why did this kind of story  
because i want to hear the truth from you
i told you not to call me again
so why did you do this kind of work to bring me here  
if you don't do this you will never answer my calls
so   what do you want
let's confess
we didn't kill him
kim se hee
you are really crazy
i talked to his parents
i told them everything
ask them where the car is
han young seok is not the one who killed kim se hee
i don't care what you do
i made up my mind
you killed kim se hee
you were trapped in that locked room
you must have experienced it in your mind several times
excuse me sir are you in  
this is the police open the door
i will not allow it
yoo min ho
there is no salvation without suffering
and you're not as smart as me
accept the truth and tell it
then everything will be easy
i will help you
did you kill kim se hee  
yes
i killed
very good
let's take a break and start again
it will all be over soon
we have come a long way
so his real mother  
although i don't know other things
it's like living and dying
you are late
but sun jay can't be contacted
 is it    yes the phone has been forgotten
he must be having a good time
it's cold
there is a warrant to search your home
what is this
your son is involved in several financial crimes
sun jae's mom
i know about your son's disappearance
it was an accident
i will find your son's whereabouts
i'm very sorry
really sorry
a news received now
a head of an it company has been arrested on charges of murder
the police have requested to conduct a postmortem on the body of the murdered woman
suspect mr yu strongly denies the allegation
did you eat
i'll go first
mom
no matter how hard i try i can't remember it
what my son told me that morning
that was the last time
i felt my son when i woke up every day
whether sun jae is at home or out
every day
but i don't feel anything anymore
what do you want
i know it was an accident
whether it's a coincidence or a mistake i'm not asking for anything
but find my sun jay
those people
there are no people who can bump into someone like you
i need to meet the client as soon as new evidence is available
 hello    are you ready  
yes i will leave now
han seung yoon
lawyer jung seems busy
he will come as soon as the work is done come this way
i am tired of questioning all night
and it is very far from here
reporters had to come here to clear the way
i don't know about the reporters but the police are watching you
the police station is five minutes away from here
is the coffee okay  
 was the contract signed    no not yet
 learned from lawyer young  give him the phone
hello  
who is the witness that the prosecutor claims to have  
i'm not sure who
hello  
 hello    hello  
hello  
it was cut
where did we stop  
they said that they need physical evidence to prove that kim se hee killed han sun jae
ok
 i have se hee's bracelet  very good
first make evidence
then tell the police where the car is with an anonymous tip
ask lawyer jang to create an alibi for busan
for hiding facts about the crime
you will get only a probationary period
lawyer
probation means i am not guilty  
i want not to be guilty
i will do my best
but first we need to create evidence
where is the car
swallow in a lake
along with the corpse  
yes
there are many lakes there
which one
but what if the truck driver has any evidence  
telling where the car is is useless then
prosecutors have no witnesses
what  
if there was a witness he would have presented himself two months earlier
i said that to get your confession quickly
then the prosecutors said that they came quickly
is it a lie  
it saved us time
you found a way to prove your innocence
are you protecting me  
so now you are my official lawyer
are you bound to keep my secrets  
there's one thing i haven't told you
i thought he was dead
really
save me
what does that mean  
there is no turning back from here
when i came to i couldn't find the key
no matter how hard you look it probably must have fallen in the dickey
take care of that too
remove that key when creating evidence
they said it was an accident
however it was too late
how can such a thing
i know it's difficult so please help me
if alive
he could have been saved
even if there are excuses you are a murderer
you said the truth
so that i can be protected
you are not worth helping
 what    killed both of them
 if people find out you're done  stop
aren't you my lawyer now  
so wait for the stock job got it  
i know where sun jae is
 lawyer    yes  
sorry for yelling
our contract is still valid right  
definitely
if confidentiality is breached it will stain my professional life
allow me to ask you for help
what lake
are you sure about this  
 yes  good
i will start making proofs soon
lawyer young shin a
lawyer young shin a
wait a little
sorry i was scared
i can't go on like this i'll find the tire chain
stay inside and wait
where did i put them  
 can i ask you something    what  
how did you catch the chairman  
himself through a case
is that so  
as far as i heard you are from the same village
you can say that
i mean first met in court
here it is
can you bring that chair  
thank you
you are also lying
the chairman's hometown is in north korea
who are you
lee hee jung
the mother of han sun jae whom you killed
that makes sense
that boy did nothing wrong
you shouldn't have gone that far
you should not have gone this far
i was very surprised by what was said about se hee almost everything was right
that's when i decided to leave my fate in your hands
so the signature must be practiced
so what  
what do you want from me  
do you need an apology  
no just find and give me my son
that map
i really told you but
then you behaved strangely
well we're both unlucky
as you said it was an accident
because it won't bother you anymore
you can't just let it go
 there you go  giving up
hello   this is number 23 from the mountain
help someone is trying to kill me quickly
do you think you are smarter than me  
what really matters is…
to live
there is a shooting incident please send an ambulance
hello   this is number 23 from the mountain
help someone is trying to kill me quickly
that's what happened
after the call came a nearby police car drove away
lee hee jung who was holding the gun was arrested
 how are you now    the injury is not so serious
since we cannot go on the roads we will treat them here first and then take them away
i never want to see those people again
don't worry
attempted murder is a crime even a first offense is serious
what about the recording in the car  
illegal wiretapping anyway
it cannot be used as evidence in court
those recordings say that you were a victim
the police will take you to the hospital
don't worry i'll take care of everything
wait a little
there is good news
what  
that truck driver died a month ago
it's a bit cruel to say that a man's death is good news isn't it  
prosecutors have no witnesses
is it  
how about lawyer young  
he is the best
there is no one better than him
that's what i wanted too
thanks for your help
the patient's condition appears to be good
you've made things too complicated can you take care of that  
you have come too far you should have stopped before it was too late
yoo min ho wa…
don't protect
i say this as an apology
you will definitely lose yourself
stop
hurry hurry
forward forward
 ambulance stay there  very clear
yoo minho didn't just come here
attorney young will come directly to your place
ok
400m left 6:50pm
you must be tired after asking questions all night
 and it's far from here  reporters had to come here for margarine
surely he had something to do here
when i regained consciousness i could not find the key
what do you mean by that  
my son sun j
i know where
in a place that cannot be found even by accident
in a place only he knows
swallow in a lake
this is private property
it is a crime for them
according to the first section of the criminal code
a crime scene can be searched without a warrant
approach behind the dive team
check other search groups at home
continue with search groups
everyone leave
coastal search teams
yoo min ho
found it
you are immediately arrested for the crime of killing han sun jae
yoo min ho
there is no salvation without suffering
accept the truth and tell it
then i will help you

# from footfairy_(2020)srt
say harsh  
found another one
ok i'm coming
who found  
did anyone catch it  
not because you advised
the police told us directly
any footprints  
not
the bag used to be my size
the way it was done is the same
killed again somewhere else
the body was left here to make it easier for us
what a good one
i want to thank him personally for this
waiting for it to meet
harsh
ask them questions
ask if you saw anything
ok
vivan
have you seen anything like this before  
the fourth body found in the last four months
that's bad news for us
harsh we want to find the exact place where the crime took place
in any way
no vivan
i don't think we will get any clue from there
he doesn't seem like a mistake maker
very talented
they kill not only because of passion and violence
a crazy thing to do there will be great satisfaction
when he realized that the victim was more
not breathing near death
then the man's attention changes
exactly that's where he makes a mistake
let's think
we need to find that mistake
that is where our investigation gets the right direction
footprints hair samples etc will get something right
mishra lost all his hair
hair samples may be needed
samples left hair lost
what do you think  
you are right mishra sir is a good examiner
i think he must be searching on google
something like the best ways to catch a chain killer
actually i'm glad the guy moved on
you think i'm not looking for that  
the internet is gone or the killer…
 you grind it don't you    of course
 hi richa  hello
 good morning  good morning
at school
college
school in delhi
10th and above college in mumbai
sorry forgot
okay going to college
your college is in front of the famous vadapav building right  
dead joke
 it is in front of the college  indeed
how are you going
by rickshaw to the station from there on foot
can't find a rickshaw in this rain let's go i'll leave
no it doesn't matter
hello it's okay ma'am
it's okay right  
give the umbrella i will bring the car
how do i look
 good  cow
a senior officer often said
understand an artist
you have to look at the pictures carefully
but this artist his painting
i don't understand one thing
why does he put the bodies in a bag instead of just throwing them away  
he is one who keeps the soles of his victims close
expecting something logical from him is a waste of time
is the latest victim wearing opentoed shoes  
not confirmed yet sir
but if according to the pattern of the killer
i am sure rita madhav also wore open shoes
except that all these people went by train
found something in common or a connection  
no sir not until now
none of them knew each other
there is no common factor
but that is what we are trying to find
the day we found a common factor
we go close to catch it
vivaan we need to catch this devil as soon as possible
yes sir
mishra also could not find anything
you know the pressure
i don't want to make excuses
go to press conferences
yes sir
we need to show in action i trust you
 yes sir  that's why you were brought
 sir  rishab  
that night he was gone around 10 o'clock
friends said that they always go by train
 his family    ordinary people
i have been in goregaon with my parents
father is a bank employee mother is a housewife
goregaon station 10th august
capture cctv footage
do not come by train after 10:30
 find out and call me okay    okay sir
vivan
a call came from the lab
did you find something new or is it the same as before  
sorry no
the method is the same
no signs of sexual assault or assault
died due to asphyxiation [lack of oxygen]
that means oxy
yes i understand asphyxiation
look at the legs
it is cut with a saw or something like that
that's why it's a bit too much
body saliva blood
fingerprints hairnothing
it means the same as before
and the trolley bag  
clean
it doesn't matter
look where to give
feel very bad
i could not imagine the pain felt by the families of the victims
they don't suffer much
i didn't think that such a day would come
same for me
it doesn't matter
ok what do you want to ask me  
yes
did he have new friends  
was there anything strange about those relationships  
not
rita is a decent girl
someone who looked after the work itself there were few friends around here
whatever happened to rei do you think
 someone you know did it    not
look we can't say anything for sure right now miss madhav
we check everything
if you remember something
or if you find out anything let us know
did rita ever say someone was coming after her  
is there any doubt that it will follow  
not
never
nothing was found in the trolley bag
it is the same as the other three bags
there are around 288 shops selling this in mumbai
there are thousands in maharashtra
 if it is taken from another state  no no it doesn't matter
reduce the search range following that
time consuming work don't get tired of it
sir found
look at the left corner
time of death  
almost midnight
this time is 11:35 about half an hour
the trolley bag was found about 100 meters away from the station
ok
harsh
 let's talk guys  okay
rishab a little further
yadav look here
look here
sir look at this
come here
come on sir
look at this
i think this is it
it really is
ok so…
the victim's house is east of here
about 200 meters away
he is from this road
if you think you have come
the killer waited for a while
very timely attack
next take her…
came here
ok this is the place
then…
it takes about 15 minutes to cut the legs
i don't want to see if he is dead again
because its design is excellent…
he must have hidden the trolley bag somewhere nearby
look for wheel tracks in the bag
 check  ok sir
ok
then…
the man has to move the trolley bag to the last place
he took the victim there
must have put it in the bag
then…
sir
footprints
hello aunty
hello how are you  
be well had a slight headache
richa  
went to college
didn't even eat breakfast
 said it was late and left  is it
found someone to cook  
no you said you were looking at someone  
oh shit
i forgot
 i will tell you as soon as i meet someone  that's okay
 tell me when you meet  of course
 okay bye  bye
vivaan rishab has something to say
so tell me rishab
you say what shall we say  
i can't even find a cook with a clue
sir
i saw a strange connection with this
i said look
related to the second and third murders
cctv footage of stations
look at this guy sir
in both cases the victim outwitted the man
he follows him like a shadow
there is more
these are the first and fourth
just like him sir
that said someone like that
alighted from the train as an ordinary passenger
the victim follows
i'm pretty sure sir this is the same person
same height same fat
what do you think vivan  
who is he  
i don't know could be
this can't just be a coincidence
4 murders 4 same men same khaki pants
isn't that footprint a size 10  
yes
height should be around 5'11
yes by far
i think this is it
that means
it does not find its prey by chance
they kill by going after them
sir
all these people boarded the train from bandra
sometimes there are some that can be seen well when boarding the train
no it won't work
he doesn't just wear a cap
he knows where the cameras are
don't make the mistake of showing your face
he is very smart
these khaki pants are like the uniform of taxi drivers
may be
the killer might be a taxi driver
may be
even if you carry a trolley bag no one will suspect
yes but can a taxi driver be that smart  
we don't know if a taxi driver can be that smart
but surely the killer is smart
even if he disguises himself as a taxi driver and kills him
send a team to the stations on the western route
see if anyone has seen anything suspicious
check out all the shops and bars on that side
ok sir
 harsh  yes  
get a list from the taxi association
about those who got licenses in the last six months
ok
 vivan  sir
i received a call from the commissioner's office
at a roadblock 3 knives were found in a taxi driver's bag
that was the blood
when the police tried to stop the man
he tried to run away
where is the man now  
bandra police
suspect arrested
said to be the trolleybag killer
he caused a lot of trouble to the people of mumbai
investigations are still ongoing
the hell
who told them to come  
someone gave me a tip
take more than you give
send them away
 kamble send them  okay
who caught  
constable jithen mangle
 mangle  yes sir
try to tell from the beginning
it's a habit sir
a road block is usually placed on the hill road
i stopped the man and searched the car
there was a bag
when he asked what was wrong the man tried to run away
so i followed
jumped over the fence and drove about a kilometer
finally caught up
where is the man now  
in prison
your name
shashikant more sir
why did you run away  
i am a poor man
those policemen
i said officers i was caught
they said they wanted to see the car
i had marijuana in my bag
i was about to give it
i tried to run away because i was scared
cannabis  
i drive taxi at night
it doesn't make much sense these days
because each one is like uber…
we were sick to our stomachs
i have a family in the village
there are small children
they need money to raise them
so i rarely do that
and those knives  
that's the blood
it's not mine arshad bai's house
i said it was not mine
but araya didn't ask
look sir
arshad bhai is from our village
he's a butcher sir
he owns a chicken shop in mahim
if sirla is not sure
come with me i will show
while he was going to the village he left the knives in my car
this is a random thing
sir
i am very poor
i am very poor sir
sir please let me go
forgive me
find out if the man is telling the truth
he's a troublemaker can't be the trolleybag killer
the trolleybag killer i don't like that name
oh finally
i thought you wouldn't come
actually i thought so too
but what to do there is no one to cook
so i thought i would eat at home instead of eating at a shop
good for the pocket
the test report came
blood on the knives chickens
amazing harsh
see
we also found two witnesses
at the time of the second murder the man was in the village
by the third virar had a hire
that's why i like you
orders are followed
but the search is over
yes so
good let's do it harsh
ok come on
anisha
 hi anisha sorry for being late  hi vivan
no problem i just finished cooking
dead awesome
vivan this is my school friend devika
hi
hi vivan
 hi devika nice to meet you  nice to meet you
devika this is my boss
devika pidi… pidi…
pediatrician
a pediatrician
you know sometimes i wonder how you passed our exams
tell the truth you cheated
 cheated  that's how i was tied up
mom
i heard at a conference
some events in life
that it will be a trigger
due to that induction ordinary people become demons
researchers are looking for time what kind of events
that it will be a trigger like you said
because of what serial killers and psychopaths are born
but so far there is no right answer
but one thing
every killer is a psychopath
but not every psychopath is a serial killer
do you know vivaan  
for stories about devika chain killers
 you are crazy  what
 not crazy right    really  
but they are fascinating
 really    yes
i mean a lot of people are
isn't it fascinating that you can't even imagine being serial killers  
looks normal
ordinary middle class people
but if you understand their thoughts
a big shock is coming
a few days ago someone told me about ted bundy [american serial killer]
i say
no one can tell that he is a necrophiliac [who has sex with corpses]
until the corpses of the victims rot
having sex with them
you know there's a lot of them like ted bundy
ever heard of jerry brudos   [american serial killer]
 a bit like ours you know  yes
he is also crazy about women's shoes
once a 19yearold girl was killed
the man's left leg was cut off
before throwing the body
he cut her right breast
made a paper weight with it
damn
yes impressive isn't it  
okay enough now
exchange your numbers
talk about it somewhere else okay  
shall we play this carrom now  
 okay  okay sorry
yes harsh  
the bottom god
apparently he doesn't like the name trolleybag killer either
who met  
for slum kids
they come to play every day
crime scene  
over here is the women's toilet
it has blood everywhere
any footprints  
not
that's water on the ground
his confidence is increasing
this time there was no attempt to hide the crime scene
killing speed also increases
two this month
the month is not over yet
sir
why did he change the pattern this time  
he did not change the pattern
he is overrated
tired of just throwing the body in the trolley bag
now playing with us
it challenges us
one thing is clear from that
man don't miss a single piece of news about him
really…
he must be collecting the news
now this the story about patul deva is going on the channels
it was as if he got satisfaction from defeating his prey
now he wants to be a star on every channel
thief
he likes it
now we have to think like him harsh
miss' deshmukh
 yes    it's sperm
we are sending a sample to delhi
check the adjustments
only there is dna data
 of sex offenders  okay
 we will inform  okay thanks
vivan do you really think this is from the sperm killer  
honestly i think it's sperm
not the killer's
see
he has never lost a hair
now a sperm tsunami all at once
why  
a sperm tsunami  
so true
harsh if your a joke
a sperm tsunami
it's dead
look i'm not sure
you say that this sperm tsunami belongs to god
but let's see you will be able to find out who it is
remember that one mistake harsh
mistakes are made at peak times
this may be his mistake
hmm
not that there is a service today in memory of vanessa
vanessa de souza the first victim
so  
okay is there anything  
no sir
sir
do you think
will he come  
i don't know
but there is no harm in trying
there are many events
the killer came to see the victim like this
on special days like birthdays
it gives them a sense of power
hmm
power  
if you have the power to decide who lives and who dies
don't you think you are god  
sir  
the man is here the man is here
 kelia  hurry up
hurry the guy is running the man is running
 he runs away  young
it escapes
catch it
 let's go  hurry up
from here from here
he goes from here
 stop  catch it
cover the other side
there you go
 take that  take the car
hurry up
taking
damn
see rishab footprints
ok sir
good evening everyone
as you know
the killer sent us a direct message
he her…
introduced as patul deva
more details in our special crime division
says coassistant director vivan deshmukh
he is the one who has been looking into this for two days
good evening everyone
you all know
this investigation is still ongoing
so i can't share all the information with you
but i will assure you that we will do our best
now we will look at some of the evidences received
help catch the criminal
we have created an emergency number
you can talk at any time of the day
we're guessing the killer was averagesized
like between 25 and 35 years
height is about 5'11
if you see someone suspicious
call the emergency number immediately
or go to a branch of the special crime branch
your safety is our responsibility
stay tuned
you are fierce no hesitation
 looks like a well mannered person  what a piece of shit
i don't like press conferences announcements
some famous stories
bored

ok tell me
how does the test work  
good
 good    yes
know   everyone talks about this whenever they get a chance
really  
i think it has become the topic of the nation
 you are right  like…
everyone wants to know who the bottom god is
everyone wants to know who the bottom god is
ok
sorry
not that do you do medicine in the hospital  
or do you eat while reading gossip  
dead joke
but really who doesn't like mysteries  
ok tell me
if a girl has bad legs
shit
do you think the killer will strike  
sorry did you say dirty legs  
 don't know   the ugly ones cracked skin…  oh my god
 oh stop  nails are ugly smelly
 what    oh getting bored
i was tired of eating
tell me
you know everyone has secrets everyone's crazy
these soles are enough for god
think
he collects the bottoms of the prey
only he knows what is in his head
do you think the bottom god will like my legs  
i said do you think i'm going to be attacked  
will god have nice soles on my legs  
are they pretty enough

we found your magazine
with your fingerprints and sperm
the body was a few feet away
magazine  
 what magazine   what  hey
stop acting
confess or break bones right  
i didn't do anything wrong so what to say  
sir i am telling the truth
i don't know anything about a magazine
look

don't you remember the thin cover to the thick cover  
how can i say about this   it's difficult
speak up after i started to warm up
you will suffer forever
got it
got it
speak up
sir i am in a small house
relatives came there
i took the magazine to the car
used a little hand
little  
can you tell me a little about this  
i felt relieved
then i threw this magazine on the train track
i swear sir
i'm sorry sir i didn't do anything else
i am telling the truth
what do you think  
is it true  
i'm not sure sir
keep the man inside
take good care

why  
innocent
went to use a little hand
you got into trouble like this

that it doesn't fit
ok thanks
sir
he has two good witnesses
who
the night of the fifth murder
the guy is from sai shakti bar on samudra mawatha
the night of the third murder
at mantra bar in east andheri
we screwed up again
it fell to zero again
catch it
let's eat
a report was sent from the taxi association
275 licenses have been issued in the last six months
shall we watch it  
it doesn't matter
the idea of ​​this taxi is wrong
how did we get that idea  
sir
 khaki pants  okay
i have 3 pairs of khaki pants you have enough
anyone can wear khaki pants
yes right
you are right harsh
these sperm bottoms do not belong to god
we ate time
no vivan
i would do the same if i were you
as the chief inspector you can't leave anything behind
calm down
don't take so much weight
what  
why wait here  
eating your food
however
we need to find something before salim sir's patience wears thin
one more thing sir
every incident has a strange connection
i mean that's probably irrelevant
 but…  say
ok sir
there is a restaurant in bandra
so  
every victim has gone to it
two weeks before they were killed
all three had left two days before they were killed
more  
why didn't you say that earlier  
i remember everything about khaki pants
but i don't remember saying this
details will be taken and sent to me as soon as possible
ok sir
listen
i am going to thane jail tomorrow
there is a message sent
a prisoner has something to tell us
shall we go
let's see if we can find something
is there anything else  
do you want to eat or say something  
no sir
 tell me to bring the bill    and sir
thanks vivaan for helping me shop
it makes me happy
i thought it was a good opportunity to go shopping
why are you so tired  
didn't you sleep at night  
worked late at night
is there a new thread  
if we get a clue tell the news by now
i think the bottom god will be found in the media before us
that means i don't get any secret information from you
as people say if you tell me
you gotta shoot me  
of course
really  
professional ethics
well done miss' vivaan deshmukh
i am also very secretive
you will not be told about the child's medical records
medical ethics right  
i didn't even ask
don't tell even if asked
you are the one asking the questions
 indeed am i asking questions    yes
oh well
you go shopping
no it's true
90 percent of the calls are jokes
i think the bottom god is my neighbor
fatherinlaw is looking at my legs he is the god of bottoms
my motherinlaw is the bottom god arrest her
god
sometimes it's annoying
sometimes i think the emergency number is a bad idea
just like the prank calls we used to make when we were kids
i want to tell you this
someone told me before
he did not go anywhere alone at night
daughter is also forbidden to go
and he said to his daughter
do not wear highheeled sandals or those worn for work
only shoes
fully enclosed bottoms
so what's the deal with nail care  
it doesn't matter
it's not that i am not surprised by this
my friend aditi
stop taking nail care from men
they don't even go by train i said
this man kills near railway stations
but the whole city is scared
hello  
yes  
yes aditi  
hi
yes
yes
yes
yes he is
yes
what
did you solve it  
one hundred percent he would like a disciple
aditi i will pick it up later right  
ok bye
what   what happened  
i was just talking about aditi he spoke
he says…
there is a restaurant called lok stock and burger in bandra
its owner is the god lu patul
he tells you to arrest him
i seem to have heard that name before
what name
you just said lock stock…
 lock stock and burger    yes
yes you've heard
it's a famous one
why does your friend think that the person who owns it is patul god  
aditi  
she is very crazy
but you know this guy is crazy
this is the first time i have heard about such a person
always going to the spa
look at other women's legs
another guy gives advice on creams and creams
about things like seawater care
i was told once i didn't care
a wellinformed fighter
that was the first person i saw
only looking at women's bottoms
you know how other people look
we must arrest him
do you know him
why  
are you jealous  
jealous  
yes  
he only looked at the bottom
really
wow marai miss' vivaan deshmukh
did you have fun  
 your parcel sir  oh too soon
yes
not that whose here  
sorry sir i don't know who owns the building
not the building i meant the restaurant
ah to miss' joshua sir
 miss joshua    yes
is he from mumbai  
no not in mumbai
but he has been here for some time
but sir i don't know much
i said i came in march
the day this was posted
that's it
can i meet him
i want to congratulate him you know
nice place very tidy
friendly staff quick service
thank you sir but sorry he is not here right now
will come in a few days
 see you next time  okay
 thanks a lot  thank you sir
 thank you come again sir  of course
 okay  bye sir
vivan
do you really suspect the owner of the restaurant  
really  
it's not a joke is it  
have you seen his facebook page  
i watched it last night
he liked the page about legs a lot
look at you too
but vivan…
i liked deepika's and katrina's pages
it doesn't read
if someone comes after them i am a suspect
 i think  harsh harsh
listen harsh
i know it sounds silly
but i'm sure there will be a clue
 vivan  listen
joshua is from mapsa in goa
exactly two months before the first murder
then there was a series of killings
i know vivaan but…
just wait listen to this
apart from this restaurant the victims have nothing in common
right  
ok
yes right  
see these comments
yes
you really are crazy
the pervert
now look at this
what kind of man is crazy about women's legs  
tell me do you know someone who…
someone who is crazy about women's legs  
i'm sure you'll say no right  
i don't know
but i really doubt this
i think we are wasting time
i know your suspicions are always logical but…
 this is a bit irrational  trust me on this
find information
ok can you  
ok sir
you are the boss
the restaurant near here
burgers are famous there look at the times
do you go there often  
no sir
why don't you like burgers  
no sir not because of that
i used to go there with my friends
hmm  
 its owner joshua…  yes  
he is our privileged customer
 joshua    yes he comes here often
but…
but  
i stopped going there
he's kind of crazy
that said how  
when the man came here to massage his legs
looking at my bottoms strangely
in a bad way
he even tried to touch his legs once
god
he is very strange and absurd
sir may i say something honestly  
yes  
sometimes i think that he is the bottom god
no sir of course
i didn't think so at first
i think now
after the murder
in the next three to four days the man disappears
how can you say so confidently  
because those three or four days
the man does not come here nor does he come to the restaurant
he must be working from home
something is stuck
it doesn't read
no sir
i have a friend
working in that restaurant
a neighbor of mine
sometimes we go home together
i just asked him once
didn't ask directly
i just asked a few details about joshua
the man said that the boss is not at home
he went out of town and said
out of town
isn't that strange sir  
it's strange
 vivan  yes
the girl at the foot massage parlor is ok
the guard does not remember the days but he's fine
i remember that he went somewhere for three or four days
it has happened three or four times in the past
interesting thing
sir
i searched for some information about him from mapsa
sir i won't believe what i found
what  
the bodies of two girls were found there within a month
the bottoms of both are missing
sir
but was joshua there at that time  
whether he was there when both of them happened or not
can't say exactly
the second body was recovered from a lake behind the church
joshua came there exactly a week ago
 are you sure    yes sir
i called mapsa police to get some information
surprisingly they recognized joshua exactly
he has a girlfriend named priya mihre
they often fight and the girl calls the police
also sir january 21st
filed a complaint against him
sir
just wait
great work
great
hello yes
 yes  do you have that girl's number  
yes sir
this is it
well done rishabh well done
thank you sir
hello
 hello miss priya mihre  yes  
i am vivan deshmukh from mumbai from cbi
we need some details about someone
we found out that you know each other
who
joshua matthews
if you support it will help us a lot
is something wrong with him  
are you not in a relationship with him now  
miss' deshmukh right  
yes
not me no one should have anything to do with him
but…
i didn't understand
what happened
i don't know if you watch the news or not
but there are chain murders in mumbai
is joshua the suspect  
what do you think
if he is the suspect i wouldn't be surprised
but what should i do  
i need some basic information
you know about his craziness… his passion for bottoms right  
that's true
he's a pervert
not normal
i am happy for what he has left
miss priya did he fight you… physically  
yes mr deshmukh in most cases
you won't believe it the last time we met
he always put me off
hit the ear
that's how it happened
i went to the police
after filing a complaint he was let go
oh sorry to hear
is there anything else we can help with  
something strange or dangerous  
there is one thing
i told very few people
but it happened to me twice
that's unusual it's absurd it feels scary
what happened
it tried to choke me
suffocate  
we covered our faces with a pillow while we were laughing
he pressed it very tight
at one point i couldn't breathe
i started screaming and struggling
after that
he removes the pillow
didn't you ask why they did that  
i asked but he started laughing loudly
he said it was a game he played when he was young
but believe me miss' deshmukh
it is not a child's game
i felt he was having fun with it
miss priya may i ask something directly  
yes
the more you know him the more you think
that joshua can kill someone  
yes miss' deshmukh
definitely
thank you miss priya thanks for the help
ok tell me
is bottoms a word  
dead joke
here ma'am it's ready
oh the smell is good
vivaan's delicious instant noodles with chopsticks
enjoy
thank you
it's not
dad called
we talked about you
what are you talking about
you are the god of the bottom who is looking at the incident
you are the team leader
more  
also you are not like a normal civilian
yes
that you also have professional ethics like those in the army
yes ma'am professional ethics
but today i am going to break my professional ethics
because you also want to know
it was because of you that we got together like this
i didn't understand
your friend
 yes    that restaurant
its owner
the man's strange behavior
wait…
my friend aditi
and that owner joshua  
are you real
i mean is he a suspect  
ok fine you can't tell me but
really  
this is really a mess
why the mess  
i said because you didn't tell me now
i can imagine he is a suspect right  
what if he is proven innocent later  
i feel guilty
you can't suspect an innocent person because i said
why are you smiling
you think too much
i put this on your head
ok
first of all i don't believe in gossip
checking everything
second rishab from my team
found out about that
so eat vivaan's delicious food
you don't want to put all the points
and those marks  
just wait
hi
 hi  what are these  
grandma made a meal your share
this is devika
this is richa
 hello  hi
is this richa you always read  
yes he is
in the college in front of the famous vadapav building
he is
dead joke
they didn't set someone to cook for themselves so i made vivaan's special dish
eat some
sorry i have homework to do
ok
 bye nice to meet you  bye
he is so cute
no  
these are joshua's phone records
the phone was switched off during the first and fourth murders
during the second third and fifth times the man was close by
within a limit of about a kilometer
do you still think he is innocent  
not like that but it can be indirect
see you're right
he has some kind of relationship
harsh i am saying this
the clues we have found so far cannot be coincidences
i like you
this is our prime suspect
no vivan
how do you ask  
to give a search warrant for these reasons  
the magistrate will prosecute me
you know very well
at least this is not certain
is he the only one found in the whole city  
someone with no old records  
sir you know how unusual this incident is
the suspect is also unusual
i feel so good this so you
 vivan  trust me
i am not against you
think a little on my part
there is panic in mumbai everyone is asking me questions
i have no answer
now you want to let it proceed based on this  
you need to find out more
i will try my best to get a warrant
salim sir is right
we need something permanent
or before the court the media will spread us
but what do we find  
i mean we have no choice
we had many opportunities with this suspect
the rest is
hello
are you sure  
ok
our burger boy is back in town
at this time you are in his restaurant
let's go
let's say hello to the bottom god
sorry sir we are now closed
joshua matthews
really…
sir joshua
this is him
cappuccino with too much cream not enough heat
always complain
this has also been seen here
these three
no i don't remember
are you sure miss joshua  
sure sure
let these victims be killed
about a week ago i came to your restaurant
isn't that strange  
strange   i don't know
maybe the right word is a coincidence
coincidence
coincidence i like that word
do you know
two incidents like this happen by chance
when you are in mapsa you are staying there  
is it a coincidence  
stay there
i think you don't think
i am the bottom god
sorry
i always thought
become a cbi officer
you have to be smart to be logical but…
i think i'm wrong
we have information
about the perverted desire for your feet
 oh my god  want to elaborate  
if caring about one's feet is strange
see i think…
from the parts of a girl's body
feet are the most beautiful
if you call it a twisted desire
yes i'm a bottom freak
look at these days
where have you been these days  
i don't eat peanuts so i don't have a good memory
give me a day and i will give all the details
what about the three or four days when you suddenly disappear  
it's none of your business
tells the truth
otherwise it will be a matter for me did you understand
i went for a walk
why   destroy evidence  
i i think you're crossing the line right  
jumping the line  
did you say jumping the limit like this  
please don't do that please stop it
 please stop oh  is this called jumping the limit  
i mean oh my god
do you remember this  
this please put that aside
 take that  then this
 looking your work  please stop
please stop
 hey looking at this what's wrong  stop
 now you go  not happy now  
 please stop  this is all your work
 jolly only when killed    put that aside
 how were they chosen    take it aside
 have you seen their legs    stop
 when they're out of breath  stop
 you're happy  shut up
 shut up  this is your last trophy
 you cut off their legs  stop
 vivan  mom
are you crazy do i want to hit  
if you want to hit hit
looking forward to what happens next
i'm not just poor
first i find out who i am
i will meet you later
otherwise don't come to my place again
 okay…  getting out now
 right now  vivan calm down
please come
come on
what the hell
you should have let me hit that shit
strike
you should have been allowed to file a lawsuit right  
we were at his restaurant
that too without a warrant
do you remember what salim sir said  
one mistake can end everything
did you see how he behaved  
it's because it's wrong
many of them get scared when they see us
you are right vivaan
but no one can be jailed for suspecting us
do you understand  
we the officials who take bribes
they set traps to catch them don't they  
 right    okay
so  
so let's set a trap
how is that  
let's bait him
who takes the bait  
there is one

goddess
vivan
what happened
why didn't you pick up the phone  
a child from a nearby house suddenly fell ill
but what happened  
what happened
i was very scared
vivan are you okay  
do i look fat in this  
that's a great idea to scare me
great
but you can't escape me that easily
if that's my idea how much
but not so
come on vivaan
maybe it was a joke made by a journalist
you don't give any information or discussion
the following is the answer
and i'm not afraid of that joshua
right  
ok
good
maybe because he went to your house
he might not have come to the station
i don't know my brain stopped
harry looked for him that night
joshua from home
i have not gone anywhere at all
where is he now  
in the restaurant
did you send that photo to the lab  
rishab was there
but i doubt there are any signs
vivan…
a college kid came
he says he saw patul god
let's go
the face
i did not see the face clearly
put a cap on it and over it…
the hood was also on so
why did he think he was the bottom god  
because you said
he wears khaki pants and white shoes
that's how he was sleeping
i even saw him leaving the station
 more  what else  
when he passed me
then i saw gloves in the pocket
and the fingers had come out
what color is it
black
sandeep
out of these five who could be the one you saw  
tell me the time
sir this one
are you sure  
sir
it could be him
i said one of these two
both look the same
it could be anyone of these two
and the other guy  
he has been in thane jail for a year sir
then there is the search warrant and the dna test
yes sir
do you want to ask questions  
no sir it doesn't matter the guy is smart don't accept mistakes
you are right
but remember one thing vivaan
we need evidence
direct evidence that he is involved in these murders
yes sir i know…
i'll find the murder weapon or something
the man is directly related to the murders
i'll find out for sure
i can't give you more time vivaan
joshua's lawyers are suing us for defamation
then you know the media will kill us
leave him alone look at the other suspects
just wait
yes
ok thanks
calling from the lab
joshua's handwriting did not match with the letters on the body
one more thing
bottom god is righthanded joshua is lefthanded
there are many people who use both hands
shut up
can i ask something
you weren't interested in another suspect
only about joshua
why  
do you really think he is the bottom god  
or do you want it to be him  
just relieve stress  
know…
more than any research
i believe what my heart tells me
my heart says joshua is the bottom god
i can't explain it but
i saw something strange in his eyes
it cannot be described
when i realized that…
next…
in the name of god
what if you're wrong  
that can't happen
i'm sure it is
i want to arrest him he…
before it harms me  
don't be afraid miss vivaan deshmukh
don't forget i come from a military family
did you see these ingrown nails  
if he comes near
i scratch his face
got it
realized
good
now smile
coffee  
do you want to talk to salim sir to protect devika  
no you know he doesn't like it
we talked yesterday
he says if he sees her near him
scratching
what happened
vivan
what's wrong  
when we searched joshua's house
he was wearing a sleeveless one
 so    there were scratches on those hands
i'm sure those nail roads
the victims must have dragged it to safety
yes but we have already checked
nothing was found in the nails
is that what the police looked at before handing it over to us  
the second person is seema bimal
there is nothing in the report about his fingernails
he can be a hero
may be lost
that may be why there is no mention in the report
but there is order harsh
what if this is the mistake we are making  
yes bhogle for doc
i need some information about an incident
did the lab say there was an oversight  
yes sir that's us
the body should be picked up and checked again
sir
sir please…
i really want to touch it
do you want
no vivan
it doesn't matter
you have a desire
final dna results will be available tomorrow
yes sir
if the samples taken from those nails match joshua
no doubt sir it fits
ok
is he under our surveillance  
yes a travel ban was imposed
can't go out of mumbai till results
good
salim sir
thank you for believing in me
i will ask harry
 okay  yes sir  
what's the situation  
the man is at home sir
ok
what happened in the office   wearing a new shirt today  
sir don't make fun of me
you are beautiful today
i am
hello yes rishabh  
sir
called the railway police
sir gloves…
sir
sir
yes rishabh
oh shit
he is 15 years old
why him this is not your style
you did this to get revenge on me didn't you  
i'll kill you thief
know  
no one cares if you are dead
tell me did you kill him  
tell the truth did you kill him  
yes
i killed her
i killed them all
all those girls
is that what you want to hear  
stop it
are you crazy
control yourself
watch what i do
arrest this thief
harsh arrest this bastard
dna report
this can't happen
this report is incorrect check back
vivaan understand
calm down
at least a peaceful ending
i think so too
 is the family okay    yes
you know i didn't want to resign
but it had to be done
joshua's defamation case
salim sir had no choice
because i conducted the investigation
it should be me
the only regret i have
the case is closed
forget it
 see you again  of course
leave a little to the left and stop
the case of patul devia is always a successful defeat for me
it was successful because we stopped the killings
but it was a defeat because it could not be caught
uncle
what are you looking at
nothing just looked
you too
that said  
a while ago there was someone like you
looking like that
i asked him the same question
so what did he say  
he said
he had a red bag from there
many years ago he had come to see it
did you see his face  
what does it look like  
like you like any uncle of your age
where did he go  

# from ghosted2023srt

this is not about what happened i didn't know him very well but
he is like me same age same job
when i went to his house it was like mine
beautiful but sad
the only thing i didn't have was a lost flower plant other than that it's an empty house
he died alone
sadie pay attention to this moment don't do unnecessary things

remainder of 20

i am not at home i am
can you find me a plant that needs more research

you know what i'm taking this
ok  thank you
sorry i can't sell you this i honestly can't
agree   are you a plant sage  
i can't give a plant to someone who doesn't value a living thing

no it's the rise and fall of various kingdoms and the important function of agriculture
yes it's about farming
so how does it work    i have stopped writing for now
a few years ago my father was injured so i came to help him work on the farm
so there is no time to write
i'm sorry  that's okay i will finish it
haven't you seen the exorcist   it's an old one
it's one of the scariest movies ever made and it's filmed here
i am not afraid of movies  that's because you haven't seen the exorcist

ok a little bet let's have a race to the top
if i lose you you must tell me what you are afraid of
i like this  dead i like selfconfidence

they can be fearless right  
when i was six years old my mother and i ran away from our country
by boat
god it's  it's more extreme than you think
sun sea waves sharks people screaming and crying
i was scared like everyone
they wanted to go back but my mother was very strong
for five days he encouraged us to go forward as we journeyed
i still remember how they looked at my mother on the beach
i want to be like him strong and brave
that day i decided that i would never be afraid again
so i'm not afraid
i trust you
but if you are afraid of that movie with a little girl it is sad
oh my mistake  what was its name  
exorcist  i want to see it
it's a scary movie you will be scared of your dreams for a month
this is awesome  this is great
not that i'm reading too much but if you ever want to have a drink like that
what's up
ok then
i know a great place
thank you
it doesn't matter what your name is how did you sing like that  
there is no such thing as selfrespect here
next to warm you up is cole turner with 20th century boy
no no no can't  where did i put your name  
what please  sadie i can't sing even in the shower
just go and see  i'm not a singer
where is cole turner    please
i can't
he will not come give it to someone else
here is the mic
thank you
you travel the world and meet great people that's life
since then i'm not so sure about it
someone i know died someone who worked with me
that got me thinking
you have everything in life but it's hard to find someone
if only people could be like your cactus
need to water all the time    absolutely right
someone who can take care of his life
someone who needs someone else to lead their life
that's a good thing
good morning
what  nothing
good night then
i mean good morning

her name is sadie he
he is fierce i know this sounds crazy
but i think he is the one
the young so fast i want to meet him
did you tell him you wrestled in school  
not  what is this  
did you take a selfie while he was sleeping   man that's weird
this is what serial killers do before they kill their prey
i was happy i wanted to remember that moment
is he going to do it again    what  
it's just cole you  helpless bored sad
a fool  what  
yeah things like stupid gifts and constant texting
that's why it didn't work out with fiona  fiona is a big girl
you are a good lover just like your mother
tell him you wrestled  i am neither helpless nor bored
i sent one message to sadie today
it's three a few more emojis don't count
counting emojis
he's messing things up remember what i said
i'm working
he's really cool
you will understand
pay attention to what you are doing is coming we have to add a lot of honey
need help  
no you just have to make it higher give it a second
do i take it i have it close at hand i bought it
hello  
good news mortgage interest rates have fallen
any news  
your phone is broken  yes it's ok if you reset
nothing happened to my phone  no no i said your life
take a village and leave your parents' house  the guesthouse
i'm sure there's a good reason for that
there is
he became more annoying to her than she wanted so she avoided him
missed    yes contact with this has been stopped
let's say for example one girl commits a terrible mistake in one night
after that the boy keeps sending her messages and emojis
he didn't miss me did he  
missed  do you pick it up    no
you are breathing hard it's better if you pull your inhaler
is coming let's go
my goodness
did you leave the inhaler with him  
is your asthma worse  
i did not leave i forgot that
it has my tracking chip
the girl of my dreams is
london  england  
london lady in the mist  no one will say that
the gray lady  no it's the new york times
are you sure  yes
he has to travel a lot for his job  that's what it means
maybe he got a last minute call and had to go to london for work
you know the money for international calls he might not have even seen your message
yes that may be true
that's it  isn't this a problem then  
definitely  yes
cole you have to go there
what  go and surprise him
it will be a loving work that we can tell our grandchildren too
mom are you crazy   cole go to london   not
why not   this is a good opportunity to go there and enjoy life
she thinks you are crazy
or he will think that i am the boy who wants to jump out of the plane at any place
but you are not a traveller
at least you have not even left this country  not
he was conceived in ontario  cole you can do this
but there is a lot of work on the farm  coleslaw don't worry about the farm
yes  take the chance go
go to him
do you know what i have  
remember that spring break i went to spain
did i skip it and get a voucher    that's what i mean
you missed spring break to buy a stupid voucher
you didn't use that either you are such a person
not today
you still have it  hirakadu also bloomed
thanks for the warning  i'm going to london
i'm not sneaking after him this is a labor of love
your self confidence is great my friend
he has come 8000 kilometers to surprise a girl he met once
this is love my friend  that's it you understand
even if he misses you  what did you say   he didn't miss me
he does not have a package to receive international calls
ok
an international art manager does not have an international call package
that is very unusual
like talking about love what is behind you  
a small cactus    yes
this is a little joke that only the two of us know
a cactus plant i'm sure he'll have a good laugh at that
we are almost there tower bridge
137 pounds
isn't it too much    yeah yeah it's tough
never take a cab from the airport to central london
that costs a lot my friend have a nice trip
(excerpt from taxman song)
asking i can't believe i'm going to sing you parts of the song taxman
very stupid i am becoming like my father
the story is true
when you meet a famous person your iq knowledge decreases by fifty
where am i  you are a living legend
stopped our shipping in turkey killed in berlin
the question is about elena and the passcode
the boss is talking about you you are in his heart
the taxman killed elina the passcode is for the taxman
how can i find and kill the taxman  
you are here  no i'm not a taxman i am a farmer
i came to london to surprise a girl and then they caught me
they are unnecessary a bit disappointing but acting
that's awesome acting as if what you say is true
that's because i'm telling the truth you got the wrong guy i'm cole turner
my passport is in my bag in my front pocket
it's fierce i am really proud to bother you
okay hold on
usually i start by taking  wait a minute
it hurts me too i like to share experiences
my therapist says i'm an empath
it means a person who is deeply connected with other people's feelings
but the boss is very worried about the passcode
do you know about schmidt's sting pain index  
what did you say   just wait
it is an index that measures the pain caused by insect bites or stings
from the little pain of the western bee to the latin american bullet ant
you can see them in a box on the table
they are called spray and pray because when they eat they wet themselves and ask for death
excuse me sir can you bring me that bag  
this is really a misunderstanding
usually we like to start with the humi and gradually increase the pain
but since you're special let's start with the killer wasp
hell
if you don't say the passcode we will start
i don't have a passcode i'm not the person i'm cole turner
look at my passport it's in that bag
acting dead this is going to be fun
but for me not for you
the flower is hell no no
you
can you walk  
what  can you walk cole  
sedi
shut up and follow me before someone rings the alarm
do you know how to use a gun    yeah yeah but
shoot anyone but me stay close to me
sedi jesus
what is going on   who are these people  
bad people you were caught in a trap they set for one of our agents
art agents

there's a lot going on here and they made me drunk
who are you
at the cia they know this failure too soon
let's keep going
god you're a spy
do you know where this is going  
get down
behind you
are you hurt
no that's the only thing i saw
i am very confused they kept asking me about a taxman
did they ask you about taxman    no they think i'm a taxman
do they think you are a taxman  
taxman will be caught in such a stupid trap  
they caught the taxman is that you  
you are the taxman  oh my god
god
ok looking down

i also lost a stone  let's keep going
cover me
stop
getting off the bus
here it comes
you can't go forward  we are not going that way
have you done this before    i will say yes to make up your mind
i can't believe that you kidnapped me and tortured me for going on a date with you
you came to london
damn the flower
can't imagine you  what  
you sneaked here after me that is not characteristic of cacti
not after you it's a labor of love
i looked at your reports you have never been to another country
did you see my report   who is cheating  
sadie
wait
kill it  they usually accept defeat
it does not accept defeat kill it
call is that good
sorry sorry
is that what i think    this was brought as a joke
it was fine before i used it to kill a man
hey
time to go
great warriors passed through these realms
brutal murderers
there is a saying if you want to find someone
you also have to walk over the dead
found the face of the taxman it does not match with intelligence data
they seem to have removed him from the news
brilliant work
i killed a man
those bad guys we did what we had to do
is that how you justify it   you are a liar
i'm not the liar here
told you things i never told anyone it's all true
not all
okay only lied about my job
i really believed you didn't i  
especially the story of your assistant who said he died that's the end
that's true her name is elena
did he really die  
where did i kill him  
what
he is an enemy agent he worked for the bad guys
you said he was an assistant  he was like that
this is what i am talking about lies upon lies  that's not a lie
it was just a small lie at first  can't imagine about you
okay i lied about my job but you lied about who you were
okay sorry for telling a few lies to please the best girl i've ever met
i do not know  he even kills assistants
what the hell she killed innocent people cole
know   i've got you
shut up and follow me
i need to get away from you quickly and go on my mission
do you know   i also want to escape from you and leave here quickly
you have to go
because i've dealt with these people before they're awful
they think you're me and come after you the taxman
i will talk to utami give us more time
the passcode  
boruslo seems unable to do the job as usual
but i know what a taxman is like and i will find him
what is this  
he doesn't know anything
we cannot lose like this
the game we play is not like the others
if we succeed
we get money and power
if we fail we die
that's only if we're lucky
please don't
please help me  couldn't be more wrong
do not
send that photo to every hunter out there
the gift is one million dollars it is alive only he knows the code
if someone kills the taxman send the gift through their head
i will come soon
like your farmer's market
come on
where are you taking me  
for your farm don't mess this up
stay close
be normal
how so  
what isn't friendship normal  
dead dead sadie sunflower
marco  look at you
who is your friend
i  i saved a normal man
you look hungry
i will put something inside you come on
sit down
the battle in that cave i should have known it was you
those are the men who stole the aztec
aztec said    a biochemical weapon
one powerful enough to destroy east veralath
it's a secret  they are trying to sell it
thanks for informing
they use those caves by paying a lot of money to the guards
there is only one who can do such a thing
a letter the one who embarrassed french intelligence
he worked a lot for intelligence
then he started working for himself arms trade murders and so on
if that's your target be careful it is dangerous
this is the best chart in town enjoy
this is for you more spicy as you wish
so are you two a couple  
yes  not
yes yes  no
it was only five months  big time
we had a lot in common the one that works the one that doesn't work
realized very confusing
sometimes it's easier to have a relationship with someone from the same job
without but i wouldn't say it's just a connection to what we did
come on do we pay attention to the work    that's awesome very sad
ok  very sad
i want to find the aztec
and cole needs to be sent back to america safely
who is it really    no one
he's a mistake
you are the mistake she said she was an art manager
i stood there for a while
what did you say  
is he your boyfriend    he is very funny
the helpless did you think you found a beautiful girl   not known to be a spy
but at least i slept with this one in the middle
no not like that
come on that's how it is for me
i lost an arm lost
whoa you don't have  yes this is a false hand
catch it  because of sadie  
yes do you want to catch it    do not how is that  
when sadie and i were together we went on a romantic trip to myanmar
went on a mission  there were many reasons
don't you remember things got worse i was caught and sadie ran away
this is what the secret police did to me
god  don't count
you have two hands but only one life
you know what i miss the most  
ok  i used to do it all the time
i can't do it anymore can i  
when you left your boyfriend he also lost his hand
what's wrong with you  nothing
i should have done the same operation is important right honey  
a little crazy just wait
did you come to save me or take the aztec  
you are the second reason  a very important second reason in the world
you're getting the hang of it brother
every word you say confuses me i know you're trying
if this man
are you taking him home or not    please tell me
i don't want my limbs to get in the way of sadie's operation
the survivors of sadie must take care of each other right  
thank you sincerely thank you very much
little thing honey the kiss  no
can't
good luck cole
glad you survived
i will tell you clearly don't try to contact me again
right    be happy
i already don't remember your name pretty sure that's a fake name too so
can't imagine  tell me about it
she is friends with a normal guy but she is fooling herself
yes  good luck
stop crying looking at her you are safe let's go
there is a small bar behind let's take a step together
this is my town i don't see anything happening here
everything else except that
go both of you
sorry about marco  don't scream it will kill us
do not be afraid they want the face out alive
i don't know about your deal but they pay you too
it pays in the world  cole shuts up
i'm trying to save you
want to say they won't pay you    sorry appa get a room
whatever it is he is not the taxman
so i'm not sam's grandson either like son of sam the serial killer
i am the best hunter there is
former best one  that's cool
shall we go  ok ok
i'm disappointed taxman it was easily caught
your girl is going to die because of you
it's dead usually it's the other way around
you came to europe after me  fooled by your lies
you two get a room  we took all this happened because of that
okay getting in the car
the girl drives sit in the middle of the taxman
show taxman work  don't say taxman again
can you tell me your name  
people call me life
what nonsense
he called it life but even lions die because lions are hungry
it is thrown out
let's go
who are you
god the hunter who came to catch the gift
you are going to die just like in wrestling but scary grown up
when this ring rotates once you will receive a 50000 watt electric shock
imagine being dead  grew up late
this is great thanks for this
i looked at how happy i was with an electric shock around my neck
fifty watts of current  i can't do this shut up
wow get a room
stopping
stop here my car is fine
i'm not saying to lose your faith but the previous two couldn't get the job done
i will not lose faith i have practiced for years and my abilities
caught two parayos
if you came looking for a gift where do you deliver it  
i will hide you in a safe place
even if i don't a rescue team will come
are you going to singlehandedly attack a plane full of thugs  
i need to find the aztec that is my only purpose
anyway sorry about marco
seriously  
i am talking about someone who died a while ago
you know someone very well
can you even do that or is it just a relationship  
and all the time biochemistry is weapons passwords shooting and killing
what is the passcode   what was the passcode  
the guy in that cave kept asking me about the passcode
jesus
does he think i have the passcode   are you telling me about this  
sorry at that time i was drunk and kidnapped
can't even believe it
besides you forgot that i am a farmer i'm not a super spy
why didn't you ask me why they were bothering me  
you can't imagine  what   what
what is the passcode   can you tell me why i was half dead  
the aztec is in a bag it cannot be opened without the passcode
elena found the dna code  said the dna code  
the passcode is the complete genetic sequence of an organism
a very long special  wow
i killed elena before she gave it to a book
so they think you have the passcode  
but i'm not around and she ruined it
but a book is there to take it from me which means he doesn't even have the passcode
that means he cannot give the weapon to his buyers
that means  he still has the aztec
that means changing the plan do you believe me
is that funny  thank you for your honesty
i can't believe you
do you understand  is it a song   great joke
you have killed a lot of people to bring our friend back
well done  thank you
but that doesn't cover my price
you will get your money
then you are the taxman
cia golden boy
your name is as funny as you are
but i know you
i know you because i was like you
like useless
but one day i was washing blood near a canal in kabul
there was trash everywhere then i understood at once
i gave them everything sacrificed everything
it's a waste of life
what are we
tools
things that don't work
we deserve more than that
give me the passcode and get out of here
if you didn't say
we both know what happens
i get what i want
you die
for nothing
god i don't know what the passcode is i am not even a taxman
shut up
shall we talk about work  
is that my money
you will get money soon
rumor has it you stole a weapon you can't use
that's why you can't pay do you really want me to work for you  
no no for money
he won't go anywhere until i get the money
then we will kill you
your boss pays big money to the one who does the job and kills the one who fails
wait and see
this fool was the first to fail
you will get your money after landing
she called you stupid
to your face
kill her when you land
get the passcode
it would be better if you left it open the next time i see you
will you come
if something goes wrong while opening that bag
everyone nearby dies don't put too much pressure
ok sir
we are looking for a genetic sequence
do you know what genetics is  
it's a cactus plant
was there
using the brain  the psychiatrist
i'm not a psychopath  that's what psychopaths say
i have dated crazy people but you are really crazy
this is more important than our lives
my plan worked better than i thought
mom   did you think i would survive like this  
we found the aztec
let's beat them after we land
we are safe the world will be safe everyone wins then
what is this
this
what
i expected more confidentiality from taxman
so am i
who are you really   paid to help  
or girlfriend    this is not suitable for a girlfriend
i don't care you will die anyway
hey hey there are
who is the fool  
i have the passcode
lies
he doesn't have it i have it
the young then let's kill him
hey wait wait
the passcode giving
of course it's in my pocket
no problem
seriously    open it
huta
i can't believe my picture was taken while i was sleeping
not yours ours
i knew you were a troublemaker
i'm not a pessimist  that's what the restless people say
let me see let me see
my goodness
take the bag
there is a parachute  and you  
operation is important
not i need to stop the bleeding first you're bleeding
call to go  i want to find
cole going  sadie i mean
escape from here
hey
get away from there
what are you doing  i don't even know
sadie  
i told you to go
i just went
with you too
how long have i been dreaming    for a while
you did a good job with the parachute
i can do a lot of things when i'm scared
you got it  yes yes
you took it
you took the aztec  yes
stay there don't worry you have lost a lot of blood
it's really very unpleasant
i'm very sorry can't think of what to say
thank you
a trifle
sorry let me
hello  
a book things did not turn out as expected
the girl released the taxman  how many times do you lose to this man  
listen to this
if we don't have the weapons ready within 48 hours our buyers will kill us all
find the taxman
otherwise they won't be able to kill you because i will kill you
boss we found the parachute
great
looking at your strength we should leave here tomorrow
you have to think about your strength
you must tell me what is this shit  
added periwinkle and gavilan
i found it on the beach it was crushed
stop bleeding and infection
how did you know that    i have read about it
every culture in history has knowledge about the crops they grow
for food clothes medicine
i don't understand why you never went abroad
here we go again  no really
you are very interested in the world
i really wanted to travel i was going to do it after i was born
tests after that it was difficult for my father too
then i went home
isn't he good    no it got better he is fine
but he is getting old
we have to maintain our products and compete with the market
anyway
they want me there
is it  
and you   your mother must be proud
the daughter is a cia agent right  
i like to think he would be proud
my mother died when i was very young
god i'm sorry i didn't know  that's okay
it happened a long time ago
after he died i joined the army
where i can focus
after that the agency gave me a purpose
our troubles make us stronger right  
no one else in the family  
as for my job i prefer to be alone
is it  
however any parent would be proud
about you
do you know something  
i can't believe that little bastard is still doing well
you seem to be able to take care of a cactus well
may be
sorry about the selfie  sorry for your gag
is it the same    okay
run
catch the taxman kill the girl i'll take the aztec
go go
here she is
this is the united states marine corps drop your weapons
screw up
where is the bag
agent rhodes time to go home
we are fine thank you
let's go
it's not too tight is it    not
wanted to know ok that's good
a lie detector jackson  
are you as disappointed as i am  
i'm doing my job rhodes
if you're doing the job all you have to do is go find the aztec
if you had done your job it would not have been lost
it's not his fault he tried to save me
without
accidental boyfriend
didn't you think that you might be a spy who came to sabotage the mission  
yes a handsome boy who tricked you and sent you to take secrets from you
patty would you look at the machine please    okay sorry
you have checked on him he is an innocent common man
an ordinary man you saved his life by endangering the lives of thousands
i let my emotions grow
just wait are you saying that saving my life was a mistake  
yes
it's dead
it's dead
sorry but they are right one life cannot be compared to a slave
yes i understand mission is more important than life
marco's hand using me as bait
did you use him as bait    yes  not
marco is right you should be friends with someone like him
someone who has no loving feelings and is not afraid of losing a limb
marco is right but not about that
we only have one life you're afraid to live it
it said it was a dead man with only one arm
you went to your parents' house to help them but they don't want you anymore
you stay away from enjoying life because of them
look at the person who says it
your duty sacrifices are your reasons to stay away from people
you are afraid to approach people
because you are afraid of losing them like losing your mother
don't talk about him
i am not afraid of anything
you two need to get a room
my goodness  patty
he was not even connected to the machine
sorry but the sexual desire between the two of you
boss wants to see you
i only said to buy a flower plant
i know he put you in this trouble
but
you are still in big trouble
you're going to be sued
why did you come to london to see a girl  
why are you protecting him  
i know this is confusing i will fix this
we can still hold a book
you were my favorite sadie
but when you are breaking the rules there is nothing i can do
does that mean    he didn't lose the aztec did he  
no no no he has a plan
no no  she is also asking for money
sadie doesn't do that
you gave the aztecs to the enemy
you are suspended pending an investigation but you know how this works
it will be a surprise if you save your job when this is over
look what he does only in the last six months
she is a liar and a murderer
do you want to protect someone like that  
want to take home  
my goodness
what am i looking at   a flower plant  
it's not a flower that's emran too a crop
they were cultivated in america for decades for food
but the aztecs used them for pacification
that plant is not his he got it from the howat scientist
he was crazy about the human sacrifices of the aztecs
the genetic sequence of that amaranth plant is the passcode
bring that plant from elena's apartment
let's trap a book using this let's send him a message
taxman ready to sell passcodes  he won't catch it
let's convince him
the passcode has been broken into four send him the first one
give him a share   that's crazy
yes the agency won't like it
if the taxman does it he goes outside the rules and that means the transaction is real
a book is missing it eats the bait
that means we need a taxman
i am   no no no
you only need to be seen he won't even come near you
do you want me like a dummy   then send jackson away
dead idea
i know you don't want to do this and i know you do
as long as livek thinks you are a taxman you are in danger
then keep me safely hidden until the man is caught
and your family  
what about my family  a letter does not stop
you can be sure of the safety of your family only if you catch it
no no no
coll it's dangerous they are using you
marune it said the same about you
who among you would not put my life in danger  
i know you are angry but this is a mistake
it is not wrong to protect the people you love
maybe you'll think about someone one day and realize that
rhodes
let me do this i know a book better than anyone
go home sadie
what do you think    i think it's a trap
check it out
it works
it doesn't seem like a trap
it must have been a good trap but we have no other choice  
the boss
mr utami nice to meet you again
when you charged me the first fee you didn't say that you don't have the passcode
we will find out quickly as said the aztec will be yours
this is mine
do you meet the taxman  
let's go together
if he has the passcode let's finish the business if not you will be killed
mr utami one condition
anyway the taxman must die
it will happen
turner go in and act normal
you leave and come back in 20 minutes
don't pull your collar then the sound is confused
sorry i can't see the suit
how many are there    it's three with me
three   all three   you can't do this with three people
the cia cannot operate in america so there are less people
fewer people   thinking of going on a trip to europe  
you guys are in the cia what does this mean  
livek's people must have seen you there we will arrest him when he arrives
do the job properly
you are not a farmer you are the taxman
hi accepted
a desk for the taxman  yes come this way
everything will be fine we are working hard
the bad ones will not come to you  three people
they have come
we saw the target he has a weapon
let's get ready to go
jackson what is that
coll  what  
escape from it  did you   ok ok
does that mean we will lose a book  
what will happen to my family if i lose a book  
i stop
he will come
i know
what a beautiful place for our first official meeting
i brought you a little something special to open for us
a few more guards no problem
excuse me your guards are no more
this way is very good eh  
how are you taxman  
i don't want to think that something will ruin our night
thank you  why  
for taking care of my bodyguards otherwise i have to kill them myself
it makes me happy
but i don't believe you  i don't care
my goal is to get out of here rich and disappear
the great taxman betrays his own country
why do you do that  
the story you told about wasting my life it struck me
so let's not delay this new beginning
the passcode
money first
doubled mine  transactions are over
the deal doesn't end there
you know that reminded me
i was selling missiles to an arms dealer and he kept haggling
then he took the missiles and came back an hour later and said
i paid too much for these missiles i want to reduce it
i said that's not how things work you can't bargain
he said i want my money not these missiles
i told him i can't take these missiles back
you kept them for about an hour  that's enough
passcode now
or both of you will die
he is very angry do you have the passcode  
will there be a passcode or not  
if you don't have it it will be a big pain for both of us
my friend
sorry i'm late
glad you came
what to say i started to remember you
what is this
a chance to test every player
mr utami since you have the money i will talk to you
exactly half of the price of a book is needed for the passcode
after opening the bag put the money in this account
you are the taxman  add ave
who are you then    my boyfriend
straight talk
if you have the passcode i will accept your terms it opens
do you have the passcode    i have friends in the agency
wait don't open it
you have to do anything when the people you love are in danger
aztec as said
thank you very much
it is a pleasure to do business with you  thank you very much
but my work is not done yet why did you think i would let you two go  
the gift of ten million to kill you will help us
i don't know how many hunters there are here but they know you
the funny thing is i got the money just like you
but the hunters didn't want to know that they just wanted to know where you were
a letter you are worth a lot
i'll take it from you  the gun
don't move anyone
your end friend  tell them not to do stupid things
what's the plan   what are you going to do
nothing you come with me
how can i come with you without doing anything  
how do you get out of here  
i will give you 20 million to kill this girl
are you ready
why oh no not at all
you take care of them i'll go around take that little bottle right
the stairs
where are you going
sadie   i am a friend
jonas    i missed you so much
listen we're not in a good relationship
that's true i lost so many parts of her
but on the bright side i still have good eyesight
jonas i'm in a big job here
i know losing an eye is one thing
but i have to tell you getting away with what's here is the best thing that ever happened to me
it changed my whole life i am a good listener
it's my other ear
i didn't even want the ear keep doing what you've been doing
wait wait wait
ok it's dead but it's a scam
you are not a taxman who are you
the person he said
i am the boyfriend
do not
you have to take me out  no you're right here
say hello to me
the hell
hurry up taxman say hello to me
you should be ashamed to waste these talents
you and i had  you don't have anything i want
what do you want a boyfriend what a pity
he doesn't know you he doesn't even see your true form
call  
call
hand me over
you look so beautiful in that dress
you should wear more suits
he is dying in the fridge  but he did it not me
how long has it been in the fridge    did you do it  
why do i put a cat in the fridge    that's pretty clear
you didn't see it when you closed the fridge  enough cat talk
that's what did it  cat talk again
by train to europe it's like death
if you want to write a book you have to do research
what is sadie doing in those places when you are reading old books about farming  
no problem i have a long list of clients i want to find
i am sure you will find them  i know i can
in the world
art management is deader than i thought
yes  yes i want to be like you
except you slept with my brother
what
we are at the dining table
do you promise to take care of this little plant when we leave  
yes i like this
taking care of a cactus plant is not a lot of work    sometimes it's harder than you think
but it's worth it  so many
are we talking about a cactus plant   water once a month
or this something between you  yes
it has a hidden meaning  yes
that's great
between your mother and me  no nothing like that
it's not about cacti  no no
it's about wrestling
did he tell you that he wrestled in school  
please drink your wine  okay ok
hi babe sorry for being late  nice car

he does this every year 
there's nothing to worry about
i don't want to be here all night
we'll be waiting
the americans will think it was the chinese who fired on them
but we're about to change all that with this
bruni's trying to start the only kind of nuclear war we can win

i thought a lot i don't think so
that i could come home for christmas this time
what
exams are near i have
a golf tournament two days after christmas
i feel like it's too much work to come home so far
because you have to come here on the other side as soon as you come

christmas is nothing without you
that's right kids
i think it would be easier to just go to bob's house
ok honey we understand
 we salute you  what  
 coming  get down
 lincoln  don't do that
don't support him this is unacceptable
am i right
actually that sounds good
that's right

up early on christmas morning
get in the car and take a trip with the remaining children
 in a foreign place  tell me
a place like miami

miami is
where the little citrus princess chooses
we can watch the miami dolphins play
the higher the humidity the heavier the hops will be
we might see a shark attack
huh  
 miami  yay
 woohoo  okay miami
but what happens to our loud family rituals  
we do so many special things together
christmas as a family  
it wouldn't be christmas if we all split up
i understand why you are sad
but sometimes plans change
 you have to bear them  you have to hit them as they come
also let's start a new family ritual
lily still can
light up the royal wood christmas tree on christmas day
 turn it out  come on
but i don't want new family rituals
i want our old customs
the love i know

a shark's head as a gift from mcbride
jaws: the musical was in the shark story
clyde that's huge and awesome
why do you need this  
we are making a fake video of a big shark
like hitting someone on the beach in miami
say it again
my family never goes to miami when the sharks are there
without your family walking
sunbathing in the hotel swimming pool  
 oh  you are right
we have to think beyond a shark attack
what is this
this is a crocodile
what if an animal
half shark half crocodile  
my family will be safe in water and on land
 the crocodile shark  i thought the shark was the crocodile
it is good let's use it
take the crocodile's body and make its tail high
hit the shark's head shark and crocodile
this kind of work requires
an oxygen welding
don't worry
i will take permission from father first
after the shark is finished making the crocodile
we can put it on dad's bike and take it here and there
i don't like it
i love it
we now need a victim of the shark attack
wow lincoln i have your family
i want to save for christmas but i can't
kill someone for it
we don't use a real person
so who do we use  
tanya we can have a lot of fun in miami

 here i'll show you  thank you
santa let me first say

now is the time to grow old
my daughter is coming to see me today

look at this
luann loud's work

this is not right
 do i know you    not
 ah  oh
did luann destroy the loud pudding machine this time  
advertise his christmas concert
this is a shame
nobody touches my pudding

no one touches scoot's bum
best thing to do
bringing someone else to christmas
i agree a good entertainer with less trouble
are you sure i don't know you  
i feel like i know him
ah no no you don't know us
i have a very normal appearance
very ordinary looking

what are we going to do with luann loud  
 yes  ok
as chairman of the board at sunset canyon
i fire him
ok
wait a minute scoot
luann is my granddaughter
he obviously got this wrong
in his campaigns
but can't we give it another chance  
ah
 oh  my goodness
 ah  i said
 okay  oh
fire him
 okay  yes

we did it
louane loud's laugh operation is a success

drinkers are decisive isn't it  
 you're right today jake  because you can't tell about tomorrow
kehelmal drink
this child is going to end
how do you drink that  
 how not to drink    do you know
a lot of homeland security geniuses you know i'm one of them
i think the next 9/11 will be an invasion of spirits
now our country has become of alcohol users
the amount is somewhere between 38%
you stop this
this devil's name is dave
dave is a security specialist at a private firm
he said how do you drink that   no matter what answer i gave
he gives this kehelmal lecture every day
i know every word he says
i know everything that happens after this comes in
at 11:05 a famous chinese swordsman arrives
he has won the championship twelve times
shik this is feng
 you know she's very popular  a chinese swordswoman  
 twelve times  won the world championship
 have i told you about him    a hundred times
really   i don't remember
 i remember  pedro give sifu feng a table
hi sit here
sifu feng is the reason i come and sit here every day
if i come here sometime after eleven he will sit at the last table here
shik he looked at me
 have you ever been with a woman    what  
have you been with a woman  
i think i'm fishing you understand
more easily you can create a ligature in the middle of the forehead
at twelve
ok i am also a little sad about what will happen next
but i love watching him rub
i know he should have been warned but this is fun
and these days i don't have a chance to smile
you can't file a complaint pedro no one believes you
at 12:20 dave yaka finally gets to work
hope the terrorists don't decide
poison the world supply of beiju roy
but not before sending these bottles here
 that's too much  sit down dave
 what did you say    i have a story to tell you
ok i was hit hard today let me tell you a little about the war story
on days when i've had too much to drink i've been reading about deaths on the roads before
are you shot in the head dave  
i have been shot in the head
a great job before i die
this happened some time ago
it's a 45 round
entered here
it went inside my mouth like a woman
i remember tasting meat
like a really well done piece of meat
it wasn't long before when i was alive again
i said shick
i felt that taste my tongue was burned by the heat of the fire
that's what i tasted my own tongue
can you believe it   it's a terrible incident
this is a true story dave
great
why don't you stop drinking  
realized
exactly at 12:47 nope
i'll get to that in a second
let's say seconds i can have a good drink
i feel like a jerk
see when i was in this bar
i can drink until they find me
i can get really drunk
then you won't feel anything
12:47 i haven't lived a minute longer than this
why am i letting this happen  
why not  
because no matter which way i run out of this
no matter how hard i fought i couldn't pass 12:47
they find me
these thugs are killing me for no reason
it's a mystery
my girl he is dead
i got to go as far as i could go
but i'm stuck in a cycle that never ends
i know i can't get away with drinking like this
it's impossible if this happens every day
i need a plan now someone has to pay for these
they have an army i only have time
yesterday was months ago
great
yes it is good
 will you guys give me some time    okay
god you
look at you
 hey  hey
are you allergic to phones  
not i just arrived my phone is off there was no time
to fix my house
 so it was also closed    yes
i mean luckily
 you got to contact me  yes
what luck to find you
it could only be seen in the bar under your house
where else to stay  
hello postcards how are you guests  
you haven't spoken in a long time
 what are you    i brought an application
the printer i bought this from is low on ink that's why delta force doesn't look right
so don't take me  
come here
they wear uniforms here so
ok good now
i ask why are these
these ridiculous clothes like security guards in a store
maroon like my dress  
no not like your dress because you are beautiful for this
 no i just said  okay
anyway how is the pay here  
do you know about it   do you pay for medicine here  
because i have a war wound
ok what are you doing here this sounds like a big deal
 did you make this for a long time    it's time to have
what is this really  
these are the results of five years of sleepless testing
this is more important to me than you can imagine
 what's going on with this    what does this mean  
this wastes time and space
then the whole planet will be destroyed
really   like being destroyed by a bomb  
you have a lot of stress
wow look at this joe
god he's grown up
hey do you mind if i take this out  
is there another one like this picture  
it doesn't matter you take how much do you weigh
i do a special exercise these days now about 175
are you still drinking
 yes  i will put 180
didn't you want to tell him  
if he can tell about us that would be great for me jema
what does he really get   you were not in his life
why do you say such things  
like if i knew about him it wouldn't matter
because of my job you have distanced yourself from me
 your job    yes
your job
you loved that life more than living with us
getting shot in war is more fun than changing diapers
ok ok the debate you do every day
i'm just a loner who doesn't want to live with you guys right  
now what to do with that roy  
we both broke up made our decisions and joey still likes you
 does he like me    yes
what does he say about me  
what do you want roy  
i lost you right  
i know i lost it i did my job
but don't let that happen to my son
that's all i ask
he is our son gemma
— dr wells  wait a minute
sorry brett
this is roy roy brett
brett is the head of security here
your office is in a restricted area dr wells
 so no guests  i told the colonel clearly
if i think it is necessary i will bring guests
i gave my application form and came to leave no problem
we are not taking anyone now
— captain pulver  tell him i'll be back soon
the colonel is waiting
what a fool
 i thought you were taking the group  we take
i'm taking
what are you saying
this is a special security detail
one in a black bag  
 rather than  really  
when do i start  
sooner than you think
i read his application i say be careful
he's not too scary
no one counts the fly in the house until the meal falls on one
i don't like him because of something
he has a trait
what kind of trait  
a person who has gained more in a hurry despite his lack of talent
the guy i always hated on the field
check out his previous work if they are true find out everything about him
if he's a nuisance we'll take care of him
talk to the common people out there
no one can find out about us buying from the best places
find some real crap
ok i'm leaving here grab something to drink
 let me do your hair  come on gemma
blood is coming
did you get my birthday present
what are you doing here you are behaving strangely
did you get it gift i sent it to you
 i don't know i didn't look  look at it then i sent it a few days ago
ok i will look into it
dr wells can i meet you
 i have to go to a hospital  i will come soon
 you took my blood  listen roy
ok i know we haven't seen each other much lately
and we both went on different paths
 i know that but  it's important to hear this listen
 you say  okay
i don't remember how to say this
i see a lot of you from joey
his determination his hopes to succeed no matter what
he has some of your good qualities but there is also your selfishness
and disappearing whenever he likes
 i think we're coming back to the same thing  running away from more responsibility
ok what do you want from me   tell me straight
i want the man i loved years ago
the one who gave me a child
strong confident you
not roy who drinks every night and sleeps with different girls
 remember this osiris osiris  okay
ok this is raigama and gampala
you know flour is not your friend
— dr wells are you okay    yes
 is smoking a nuisance    not no time
the spindle
we are experiencing a slight delay
what do you mean by small  
a week two weeks at most
 why    this is not a proven science
but that's what we're looking for isn't it true science  
your friend captain pulver
 yes he gave an application  why did he do it  
when i met one day i told him that i was from the army in the laboratory
why is that for you  
the security situation of this company is not something that is talked about in bed
i can say with confidence that it will not happen
 roy and i  but you have a child with him  
sit down take it easy
i don't want to see this as an interrogation
i'm not a talker
i've always been a fan of brevity
short is better however
there is a story i often tell
i would like to share that story with you now
if you'll let me
 i like long stories  great then we are lucky
in burma in 1979 i did some undercover work for the cia
at that time opium jumped to our country
years later we faked a big dangerous military coup
many of these things are secret
after a while i found out
in the jungle outside rangoon
shooting at the soldiers of the liberators
after three days of fighting my entire team was lost
now i'm here
where a band of wretched rebels pass by
with ugly attitudes and the last lousy hygiene
all i have left is a gun with a magnifying glass
36 hours without sleep a need to win
then i hear
this frightening sharp sound
like a whistle
a wild boar
pee in your pants
disperse the rebels with only that sound
no one wants to fight with thorns
now this son of a wolf comes chasing me directly in front of me
now i would rather kill ten people than kill an animal with ammunition
but before i come
an 18foot eagle with a doordie attitude
like a christmas ham coming from a tall tree the greedy is caught
i have never seen anything like it
over the next few hours i look forward to
like a snake killing a big pig
it's strange but i can hear everything
the sound of the pig's bones breaking the sound of lungs bursting
it's like the snake laughing
but still my favorite violent scene continues
but i get attacked the most
although the eagle spreads its wings more than two feet
his calm and measuring eyes
till at last till he is in the middle
when puffed up from the pig's outer pieces
i saw a stack of eggs
eagle eggs
little by little the pig breaks the eagle's nest
so the first thought i felt the act of anger
it really happened to love
the snake kills the pig not because of hatred
prevent him from being swept away by nature
that story is great
glad i said it did you learn  
 what    no more visitors to the lab
no exboyfriends old friends people you don't care about
if there is any delay in the work
i want to know that very soon
 right    definitely
thank you dr that's great
watch the stairs
 do you want another one    what else  
you are great
how long have you two been dating  
we met today
 this is my new boyfriend  i am
 alice is a dentist  it's funny because i can't see the teeth
i mean even seeing them makes me sick
 then a job in the dental profession  isn't that the last thing i should look at  
i know that i like challenges
i like to put myself in a difficult position
 that's the only way to grow  that's right
he is very beautiful isn't he beautiful  
how long have you two been dating  
gabriel   ever since the day i started drinking at this bar

 conventional equipment    one that can fit a human body
 do you let her out or put her in    what's the best  
if you don't want to know that this person is looking out for you  
for that putting it inside the body is very good
the ones that make the body stronger are often found in clothes

many people think put it inside the skin
 get into the skin  where do you put it  
 you mean me    yes you personally

 $75000  okay
what the hell would you do pam  
pam  
i don't know your name so i called pam
 have we met    many times
let me see it immediately
hold above the trigger
use this very carefully
a lot of music
  ah    adolf hitler
 what    this was given to him by carl walther
hitler kept this on his munich desk
did you kill me all these days with hitler's gun  
 this was stolen by an american soldier in 1945  my goodness
 what happened to you    if you look at today
 it cost me a lot  i didn't think it would be so complicated
 who sent you    do you want to know  
 give a hint  no time
 are you going to kill me now    no pam i shoot you
it's for the jews
these too
come on guys
gemma put me in this on purpose i don't know why
there must be a good reason for that
look your phone is gone
but he is not now
i can't contact him now
so none of this matters
now all that's left is to make it work
revenge
everything is hot now
 did you finish him    are you asking about them   plural
 marshall  hello brett
don't ask who this is because you know who this is
 where is marshall    who is that   bomb boy  
i named it kaboom
he is with the group now put on a barbecue
we only have two less you are the one who gives the order to shoot
you think there is someone above me
you're just a dog friend there must be a brain there
i want that person
i want the person who killed gemma
i think it's venter
 you know where we are  yes i know how to get there
i'll be back in a minute honey
i think the boss is on the top floor
but as soon as i enter this i will die
let's start as usual and break down the door
this is a good plan
i catch his eyes
146th attempt
wait
back off
i can do this again you idiots
147th attempt
hello the second roy
congratulations the second roy
the second roy had no weapon
so i'm sure can't leave here with weapons
sir
yes sorry

it must be something about me
148th attempt
sir
hi roy
am i like in butch and sundance at this point  
not
don't say dying
that's strange
149th attempt
stupid buffalo
150th attempt
hello guys
you have cut my throat several times
looking back he is very busy
what do you do with it  
i meant to screw you
do you remember that one idiot in raiders  
who swings a sword here and there thought he was cool  
indy shot him because he was fed up and out of patience
don't let that happen again
 do you remember that    yes
the hell
there are a few things you need to know about dying by the sword
apart from my 15th attempt
being killed by a sword is harder than being killed by a bullet
it is a fact that many people do not know
it hurts the most when it comes out
one more thing: harrison ford is crazy
that is why the shots were fired
151st attempt
my name is guan yin
guan yin did this
152nd attempt
my name is guan yin
guan yin did this
153rd attempt
my name is guan yin
guan yin did this
156th attempt
my name is guan yin i did this
this is not the best part of it
that's venter
the man who killed gemma
the stupid thug who killed me 150 times
captain what you think when you first see it is really important
how did you manage to kill the people on the top floor  
because the people we sent to you are the best fighters
regardless of the end i appreciate your effort
for those of you who fraternize with the scars of war
it must be hard to bear this defeat
he has memorized this nonsense story because he always tells the same story
every man who saw me die died thinking many things
i see only one thing here
it is in the eyes
their brightness is the same
repentance sorrow
what did i do what did i not do  
all their hopes are melting with us
but if we can rebuild the world erase the mistakes  
if the ability to rewrite the past is true  
 adolf hitler pearl harbor  wait a minute wait a minute
i have never lived more this piece is new to me
in whose hands will a powerful weapon like the osiris spindle be given  
i know your answer captain
in my hand
the one who came to save people from their wrongdoings
a man who understood the dangers of war
who else understands what happens with such a device  
absolutely right
i feel sorry for dr wells
he took us as far as he could
good girl
ever since you came here you wanted to get blood on your hands
you only have blood
but it's not mine
this is very sharp there was no blood
 is this a katana    a katana   it's a japanese one
 this is a chinese sword  let's stop racism
this is a sword
brett
i now know three things
that i'll screw this guy next time
two: this stuck me is called osiris spindle
three: venter doesn't know it works
anyway gemma put me in it and started it all but why  
osiris revives her dead husband
osiris becomes the god of death
and after death
i am osiris
gemma did this to me stop them stop venter
while i do that he replays my day
he believed me
son of a bitch he still believes in me
he knew i could win
hi i want to know how to fight swords
i don't know what you mean
i want to learn to fight with a sword
i like something of yours
i will go back home to shanghai tomorrow morning
 i only have one day  i think we can do something big in one day
158th attempt
161st attempt
i usually can will learn soon
it's a weapon depending on who wields it roy
this sword is like a piece of your own like a car key
i have general training but i like to work hard
for useless hands this jian sword too
just an iron
but to two well trained hard and sharp eyes
it is a deadly weapon
i had a good teacher but i want to learn more
174th attempt
198th attempt
200th attempt
hello guys
do you surrender  
you really don't want to fight me with a sword  
i like your confidence
usually i talk more
i have something to tell you
but i will wait for that
let's see the size of the iron
a stray dog
i wanted to tell you
i'm roy roy did this
wow
brett
i smell food do you feel the same  
i will take care of it
now i am blind
 looks like a four hundred pound unicorn  you are bally's son
 are you going to buy this gun    not
 do you know why    not
because i get so much pleasure from watching you poop
how  
what do you think
 spindle he made it work  gemma he put me in it
he put me in it to stop you
then you killed him knowing who you were venter
tried to be an emperor the world has changed
kehelmal revolutionaries
before he activated that device didn't he tell you
if this activity if there is a long time the world will be destroyed  
don't worry idiots if the world is going to end you won't see it
spindle gives a power of god
it rebuilds the world without worry
 adolf hitler 9/11  stop that nonsense lecture
the past is the past it was designed to be that way
we live by learning from the past
this means an abandoned husband and a failed father
i thought you'd like it better to change the past
 what about your son    my son  
joey right  
if you've come this far to kill me
who will save him  
i didn't think joe was in danger
i never thought that he was a target
i'll kill venter and the rest of these bees
a thousand times if the child is disturbed
sir sir step back from that belt it is forbidden to go that way
back off those straps buddy
how many times would i have let him die  
my baby
this is my baby gotta save my baby
do not
now is the time
end of the world
why not
my world is over
i can feel it not only death
unexposed piece by piece of me
with everything else
now there is no place left to run the only person who can help is dead
if i take his revenge  
i killed him too not venter i killed myself
i killed him the day i left the family
i killed him the day my child ran away from growing up
i killed him when i didn't talk to him
he died because of me
joey died because of me
the world is destroyed because of me
205th attempt

you don't understand
you're too smart for a boy who doesn't go to school
i have my ways
you beat me again

i missed this for so long
he has gemma's looks
his laugh his jokes
my goodness
then this child laughs i see myself
just like a picture
i saw my own face smiling at me
it broke my heart
i can do this forever i do it
i've ended the day like this dozens of times
never bored
i like that he's sleeping when he's destroyed
i wish he wasn't upset
i would like to tell him that i am father as i said before but i'm afraid
i'm afraid he won't look at me that way again
if i didn't see what he saw in his eyes
that's why he didn't say anything
249th attempt
i want to buy a boat one day take mom in it
he never goes out
if only i could rent one one day
 is it possible to rent    a boat  
yes take mom with you
 i don't see any reason  when  
someday we can…
this is when i tell him let's do it this weekend
then he sends a message to mom that we are going boating
this is usually something else
joey
 your mother  yes  
 do you know what mom does    spindle of osiris  
spindle of osiris
do you know what happens with that  
he can't talk about it because it's top secret
but i heard one day he says that it could ruin everything
i think the whole world if they are not careful
do you believe it
yes i agree
i wish it wasn't so
your mother trusted me with something but i couldn't do it
what does it mean  
 last night your mother  she didn't come home
 i know  has she got a new boyfriend  
not no new boyfriend
does he know i dropped out of school  
 i felt like you were following me  yes i am back
but that's not what i came for
 why then    i don't know
i saw you and i wanted to talk we need to catch up
why did you think i was following you  
because of something my mother said this morning
 what    by phone that's strange
he said if there is any trouble for me go find you
joey this is mom pick up the phone
 i don't know what he was talking about  did you talk to mom today  
if anything strange happens call roy right  
 at what time    i don't know
i'll give you his number take me back bye
honeygive me your phone
when i woke up he was still alive
venter didn't kill him
he was not dead then
don't worry son i'll be back
i'm coming for you both
you killed him
 how did you get into this    where is he   where is he
 are you trying to destroy evidence    we tried to find out what he was doing
 how does he turn the spindle on  shut up brett
say says
we couldn't get osiris to work
something he did caused a cycle of events out of control
he messed it up with something not working now
son of a bitch
the spindle is working
it's you he took you as the low mass
or how do you get into it that way  
how
how many times have you done this  
 a lot of times  it works
he was still alive 14 minutes after i got up
i have time to save him
ok let's do this
only gemma can stop this
you have 14 minutes to save him
what the hell here it starts
that fool jumped to the ground
go dogs
i have twelve minutes let's go fast
go
came great
i want to do the last thing
a royal war
all these people were brought then i can finish everyone at once
because i have been waiting for a long time to do this
it's been a long time
i mean i don't have all day
hey brett
you came to find me
you did it
you came for me
 how many times did you go    all at once
we don't have much time come on
i couldn't tell you they were waiting
i had to sneak into this every night
the book was sent to you with great difficulty
it happened
i think venter joy sent people after
there is no one left everyone is dead jemma
joey is fine
he skipped school to play computer games that is all
how do you know that  
he likes a girl in class the name is camille
he showed that girl every bus route to school
but afraid to ask him to be his girl
it was his friend wyatt who lied about their ages
a few weeks ago went to play paintball
you asked about a spot on his neck didn't you  
it happened an insect ate
last month he broke his arm while playing in the snow
 now it makes a clicking sound  click
he loves dogs especially for pugs
he thinks you two have to save each other
about a year ago he painted a van gogh painting in oil
it's for your birthday because he knows it's your favorite picture
he thinks that mom works too much and doesn't smile
but that child loves you very much
how can i stop this gemma  
this is not to stop roy to start again
i made your measurements and genes as its missing mass
what does that mean  
that means you're in the middle of it and then theoretically
the cycle of time will start all over again
 according to theories    i don't know
i really don't know roy
this whole thing is cabled together i was only trying to stop venter
i didn't know this worked until you came along
you know i saw you yesterday
but i haven't seen you in a while
i had nothing else to do what should i do  
i know about you
i know about you
but i don't know what will happen if you go inside this
but i know what will happen if i don't go
did you see that doomsday  
 yes  what is it like  
if you take the worst possible way it will be a million times worse
is this going forward   am i going into this  
will this fix everything   you and joey will be careful won't you  
if you get into this you'll be fine
you will not be saved
you're stuck in this
then
hold me and tell me you love me
i love you
 i'll wait until then  i will stay
what the hell here goes

he thinks you are someone from my old life
don't think about him
kyle he has worked with a man named dante
they picked up a kilo of cocaine from the vikings
 who is viking    a big drug dealer
 do you know him    yes when he was a young boy
 i know his boss too bullitt  does dad know him too  
when bullitt wants a tough job done he's the man then father me
then viking took over
a viking is a strange creature
he likes to hurt
i'm gonna kill him brock
you will do it
why do you think you can kill a man  
i am
i killed three of his men
what happened to the bodies  
surrounded by wire netting george was thrown into the falls
 wire mesh    yes then eat fish
the fish is eaten until it becomes bones
then gas will form in the bodies and will not come up
they sink to the bottom
 how did you know that    it was in a crime book i read
 this is my brother  brother  
my butt
i know
 maybe i  shut up
stay away from trouble
the things we do for love huh  
he was working in a massage place
they sent me to finish him off instead
how are you grace
he went
the woman knows the exact time
how do i find viking  
you can't
 you are now at the top of the innings  we will see
one may disappear two   i do not think
three   with ten kilos of cocaine  
maybe they got together
are you saying that three of my servants escaped  
does that mean i have the last chance to catch people  
 not  not
kehelmal indians did this
all this is father's fault sleeping with them
sorry indians  
when viking's father first started
he made a deal with an indian named white bull
dad gave him stuff he took care of the work in the separation section
white bull wanted more
 so father gave white bull some small towns  like many
after that kiho made a ski town it became a gold mine
what is the lesson that history teaches us  
indians should be kept in the separate section only
those indians always want more
because they think that side is theirs
there is some truth in that isn't it  
white bull gave this to my father
the day they made the deal
ok
now is the time to give back
 what do you two want to do    you can sit down and tell your story
 i have too many people today  that's cool i only see you
tell me you work nights
thursday why  
if you are so beautiful in the sun how would you like to look at night  
eggs bacon pancakes
and you  
surprise me
ok
i was 13 years old when my father passed away do you know his last words  
sleep with every waitress who serves you
these indians will not come
tell me about your hotel secret
give me twenty
this is not magic
this is a beautiful find even steve jobs is happy to find this
 steve jobs    that's right
do you know why he became a bad character   simplicity
 now tell the story  okay
i stay in a hotel 100 nights a year
every morning first thing clean the room is posted on the door
the girl sees it and opens the door
now remember these facts well
all this is well thought out
i am lying on the bed completely naked
the first part i look into the girl's eyes right  
otherwise he steps back and closes the door it's over before it starts
i'll take the twenty take it and put it on top of mine
 boom  for twenty  
their wages are $835 an hour their lives are miserable
that is the seriousness of this
the ball is in his hands
he can go back and forth over
or he can come and get this
 what is your success    31%
100 hotels per year you do the math
he has the kind of yellow gloves that white bull wears
 is it an indian thing    i guess
it is good
this is as good as steve jobs
i see the same problem situational control
i pay twenty dollars you can't buy a beauty queen for that
but there are not 31 cleaners in this country who are fit to sleep
you will be surprised
my goodness
tortured all night nothing can be taken from him
you can't
you know the pain
it is a religion for them
you know french mobsters consider torture an honor
how do you measure it  
he is a ute
 what now    these indians are utes not french thugs
you know i am married to an indian thought i didn't know the difference  
your mother's womb must have been straining to bring you into the world
died simon legrave eagle
in many cases these things do not happen
it happened now
this is his first job

 how long have you been dating    god it's been two months
i told him to find out about our hanged man his name is simon legrove
his father white bull
he's a native drug dealer from denver
doing this work for 30 years
now white bull shares his territory with viking
he is also a trafficker in denver real name is trevor calcourt
so
i guess
here it is a cold war
a war over drug control zones
many here
what do we do about this  
my 30 years of experience tells me this is a problem in denver
don't you mind i found out about a drug dealer here
in five minutes more than you've known in 30 years  
what bothers me is kurt is going to sleep tonight happy to have you back
kurt is a big boy
i knew you were coming back
ok viking's real name trevor calcourt
if you want to kill him find a hired killer
 an assassin    yes
do you know someone  
eskimo
how does this happen  
you get the eskimo a train ticket he is afraid to come over
pick him up from the train station drive to a hotel
give him half the money
then go home
 how do you know if the job is right    see denver papers
it will be their biggest news

 second question  okay
who taught you principles  
what did you say
you made a contract to kill me ninety thousand years ago you did not honor that agreement
that's because i like this agreement

how long does it take to make sure the broth doesn't boil  
how long does it take to make sure the broth doesn't boil  
on a quantum scale that might be true
does anyone know what the quantum sino event is  
a system that cannot be changed while waiting
wow don't say it all at once a system that cannot be changed while waiting
wow don't say it all at once
ok that's it
one of the oldest things in quantum physics
simply put temptation stops change
atoms don't change while you wait
ok we are out of time for today
have a nice holiday see you after the holidays
happy birthday
zoey can we talk for a minute  
i read the report you wrote about the quantum sino incident
you want to talk then
share what you know
but just to be careful in your own room  
i will try to talk
apparently reducing the number of variables
your life will be a result of control
but life is not a scientific research
you can't control your world
try doing something that scares you
can
ok
ray this is jason listen

i drive an 18 wheeler
before an accident happened some time ago
i read about some autonomous vehicles
learned another thing big auto business
it is the first to be automated
so i'm going to get one like that
before the robots got me
 that's a great story  that's my life
he must be very mad
for paying a lot of money here was on the website
that no one has escaped yet
if we can do it we are
the first group you don't know
what are the rules of this   what  
you have to escape from the room before the time runs out
what if you can't escape  
someone came through the door
describes the clues you missed
he will make you look like a complete fool
when does the game start  
we are waiting for the match regulator
come and explain the story to us
until taken to the room
just like this is a zombie attack we have to find out
medicine before eating us
i like that it is good
until the match officials come and find a place to park the vehicle
i'm going to have a cigarette
oh
shik
hey the lock on the door came off

zoey
give him some time   amanda just died
why don't you guys understand this  
we don't waste a minute
amanda is dead we are still living
the strong survive
will you stop being an idiot  
what is your problem
amanda is not weak right   he sacrificed his life for all of us
ok so let's not waste that dedication
without us dying
this is my room
exactly like that
this is my bed
me
this is amanda's
a bomb blast
he is the only survivor
i was on a plane with my mother
on the way from vietnam
the plane crashed into a forest
it took a week to find me
i remember that
you were in the news
my school friend and i went on a boat
suddenly a wave came
the boat capsized
i tried to grab a rope
my fingers started to break
wet
holding the boat in a freezing cold place
we both had the same jacket
nathan he suddenly became impulsive
it is because of the decrease in body temperature
they told me later at the hospital
nathan come back
on the second day he swam
i don't know what he was thinking he saw
but there was nothing but the sea
the next day the marines found me alone
what about you
i was the first to buy a car from my friends
that winter time we got together
had a fun night
i wanted to take everyone on a picnic
i was drunk
i and about eleven others worked in a mine in virginia
my little brother cal was there too
there was an accident inside the mine
cal and i were staring at each other
i couldn't see him but i could…
i heard him gasping for breath
i heard him take his last breath
by that time the rescue team had arrived
i was the only one who saved my life
they know everything about us
every detail i mean they know about the jacket
what my friend was wearing that day on the boat
rudolph the rednosed reindeer is
the song we sang when we crashed
they made these rooms for us
they sent the boxes in the names of people we knew
my cousin sent me have fun
 they hacked that phone  it's danny's
carbon monoxide poisoning
all his family died and he was the only one who survived
none of us died did we  
 we are the only survivors  and so  
we are statistically unlikely
now they want to see who
the luckiest of the lucky
are you willing to let dr wutan yu
make you better people  
open new doors and test your limits
don't settle for a fluid existence
live to the fullest
place your order in the next five minutes
get a free checkout
ok at least now we know how much time we have left
knowing exactly when i will die is a huge relief
don't you understand  
they have chosen us to see who will die
you join us now stay with us
we cannot continue to obey their laws
what else can we do   they are watching us
they know everything we do
they are waiting
i found something
come come
this is right here
ok what do we have  
a hand a finger two fingers this
this could be 012 right   it's a code
no no no that means
ekg
yes this is sign language
my cousin is dumb they must know that too
see if there is an ekg machine here
hey what are you doing
quantum sino event atoms do not change
if you keep researching…
so while they look at us
we cannot change our situation
this game is designed for them to win every day
ok ok but now we need your help
can't we can find another way out
we still don't know how to get out
stop crushing everything and take a deep breath
are you willing to let dr wutan yu
make you better people  
hey zoe calm down
in three minutes they will send us poison
we don't have much time you calm down
stop telling me to calm down right  
you are not listening to me
friends there's an ekg machine here this may be the way out
 ben take off your shirt  what   why should i  
because this is the next clue
come on this is just an ekg machine
no no nothing is left in this
that door will open in a heartbeat ben
 we don't have much time  quickly
do it come on
grab this take a good breath
your heart rate is too low
this doesn't work
someone else has to do this
mike we need more pulse let's do yours
what i'm not your rat try it yourself
ben was fine come on
i will see next we need more momentum
ok let's try
zoey please listen to me for two seconds
shik
we are in an iron box this will not help
stop breaking the river and help me
loud loud loud
not
open new doors by testing your limits
limits check limits check
 we need more pulse  are you kidding
i'm already crazy
my heart rate is still high
shall we try these  
what should i do  
 we have these  what   are you mad  
when the marines found me
my heart was half dead
with these they revived me
these are the ones they used
this is not an answer
listen this is a clue they had this in my room
because they know i will do this
your heart rate is too high anyway
are you kidding take these away from me
listen to this you idiots
we will be poisoned in another minute
then we die of suffocation
the air we can breathe is decreasing
just like what happened to you in the mine
shik
think about your brother
isn't his name cal   this is your time
mike you can save us
that's right you save us mike
 save us now  okay
do do soon
 james what are you doing    that's right
do not
 hey don't stop  stay away from me
you are trying to kill him
come on
mike   what did you do
he is not breathing mike
get up hey stop it
come on
mike
open new doors and test your limits
limits check
up and down more and less
one two my goodness
shik
i really don't know what to do
what the hell are you doing
the extreme maybe they say the least
hey quickly
soon
shik
mike
mike
that door that door it's open
zoe hey
soy
soy come on there is a way out
there is a way out
you will be breathless
you go
 oh  you guys go
shik
we had to drag him out
we left him to die
he made his decision
what's wrong with you
what happened  
i saved our lives
you killed mike
he died because he was sitting for 12 hours a day
if not in that room it would have happened in the next one
this seems like something you do often right  
is your friend on the boat  
what are you saying ben
say it in your own words
one jacket for both of you
give me that jacket
it's so easy to say he swam to his death
don't do this
it is not lucky that you were the only one who survived
accept it
you killed him admit that you killed your friend
living is a decision
you do it too
open your eyes and look for a clue
hey this is a door
i think we should open this up
what makes us fall  
ok i will do that
 this is tight  hold on brother
you guys i'm not a regular gym goer
my goodness
ok ok
what do i have in my hand  
seems a bit confusing to me
hey hey
what have they put into this  
hey you're melting melt you
 what    you're melting
what wait look at this there is something to this
go from here if you like but we'll see…
the best thing is to find an antidote
how do we do that  
get up and see my goodness
who's counting   we are going to die in this anyway
i will not die i will not die here
ok
where is it come on where is it    
 where is this thief    where is it    
ben ben
 i met n  give me that
that's mine
chic
shik
my goodness
ok i have ten minutes and four places
i need a four digit code
enter the fifth room get ready
getting ready
we have two corpses
ok
twenty minutes to remove the bodies and clean up
ok will do
look at this the oxygen tank
what the hell was he trying to do with this  
breathe bally
shik
now you are a dark horse
i bet jason
but you see that's what makes this game interesting
anyway after the burn
stoned poisoned broken bones
but you somehow escaped from the last room
did you ever think you could do something like that  
that energy that commitment  
sit down celebrate
you win something right once
so you're the one who made this mindblowing puzzle  
not i am the referee
the puzzle maker is the one who makes the rooms
but you kill people for fun what's up with that  
you killed all your friends
because you didn't want to pay for a rental car
i wouldn't put too much faith in a vehicle like that ben
since the beginning of civilization
we knew something exciting
when looking at people fighting for life
that's why we watch movies games celebrity murders
highway car games
but now the world has softened
everything is safe everything is done carefully
so we made a game for people
still have wild feelings
we gave them a separate seat
watch the greatest drama of life
our customers are very powerful
stay in this world
but every year they ask for more
very complex rooms
more interesting people
different ways gambling between life and death
last year they took school players
before that the intellectuals of the year
those who saved their lives alone this year
they wanted to know if luck played a role
lucky people don't get picked on by psychopaths
you know it hurts
when you call someone a psychopath
i thought i was stupid
but here you are
we have the lowest bet winner
still living
i really didn't think it was possible
but like i said
you don't think much
that means i win
then i can go home right  
ben
at the end of a horse race
do you think the horse gets presents  
sh
shsh
hey hey ben
come on ben where
ben
ben get up please ben wake up
do not
you can't go out until the game is over zoe
ok we need to know exactly
he is dead
ok come on
come on there is an elevator here
you came for me
yes i was the only survivor
 soi go go go  ok
it's been 24 hours now he is fine now
you rest now
he is ready
dr bell go to the operating room
miss davis  
can you come with me now
yes you are right let's look at the roof entrance
ok everyone everywhere
miss davis
this is the first room right  
it transformed into a large oven right  
there was a big fire here it came from the ceiling
we couldn't find any evidence for what you say
that one this is the window
here was a big picture
have you ever imagined things before  
these are not my friends
ben was here
when he gets up he also says these things
ok your friend ben miller  
we received a report from the hospital
they found three types
illegal drugs in his blood
no way out
 miss davis  it's a typo
dr wutan yu
are you willing to let dr wutan yu
there is no way out wutan u
 wutan yu means no way out  miss davis
no way out wootan yu
this is also part of the game
we need to get out of here
wutan u

thank you
will you tell me what's going on  
i am the new regional sales manager for this province
i am now talking directly to the servers…
we have to start somewhere
i'm proud of you
is this homework  
what is this
mike nolan dies of a heart attack
in a closet at union station
jason walker dies after being thrown from his motorcycle
the presence of drugs in the blood
danny kahn dies in lake michigan
amanda harper is a solo climber
it seems true
fall from the mountain and die
articles like this could have been written about us
you must drop these now
i can't just pretend they don't exist
everyone else who received this invitation is dead
those who sent them are still alive
don't you want answers   we can find them
they made this game to beat us but we won
we beat them at their own game
i don't have much to go after them but
logo
this is an impossible object
this is escher's staircase climbing back on itself
there is only this
these stairs are numbered in order
2322 start again at ninety degrees
they are coordinates
it is an unregistered building
in the middle of manhattan
they hide in the middle of the road
what are we doing
 i bought plane tickets  airline tickets  
for two weeks i leave
zoey this is called survivor's wrath
my psychiatrist always says because i want to live
living is not running away
i have daughters are you coming
ok
yes i am coming let's do this
you're not jason bourne
 right    hmmmmm
come on it has to be here somewhere
found the place is in x's
where is it
it should be this i have weapons
right here this seems to be related to the nail we found
ok
leave it at the door see if it spins
you can do
 anything    this doesn't work
 see if you can spin it  this is not right
 look clockwise  clockwise  
 yes  okay
 what happened here  what  
the ground is the ground  what is this  
this is another puzzle
i fly without wings i cry without eyes
 what does that mean    i don't know give me a minute
get your head
get ready to crash
 wait cloudy  clouds  
 yes cloudy  ok
look at the door come on let's go
pull close to the ground
pull up the ground
no no no come on
wait earth
do something
pull up pull up
end want to look again  
not good work let's get ready to play
i hurt myself with that nail again larry
finish the game
what is the survival rate  
it is approximately 4%
this won't be a game if you don't give him a chance
we got his flight details
i'm so glad zoe has gotten over her fear of airplanes
let's play again

i am fine thank you
how is the new couple  
 how    good mom
 how is the new family life    great isn't life
we are a happy couple
how do you know all of ditto's nonsense  
crazy work   my children are not stupid
no nonsense just some weird habits
like dropping wet towels on the floor socks everywhere
his underwear
why not sit here and tell the world about underwear  
 okay baby  i am thirsty
can't believe you ditto
 let's eat cha  i want something to drink
will you give me some too  
what is your problem
you seem a little angry do you have menses  
do you think i mean it every time i get angry  
i have good reasons for this
if you were a little bit in love i wouldn't be mad at you
miss you
come on we talked about this before
when we were friends we were like lovers
now we are like friends when we were lovers
now you are like a wolf in the skin of your wife
no problem forget it i don't even remember why i'm angry
may be
don't scare me
it can't be
we are still married there is no way to have a child right now
alive
let's get together and see what happens  
alive
i want to pee
i can't wait any longer
come on
life
i was joking
have i given my friend a child  
this is a lie right   this is not my child is it  
you
so what about our plans  
can you help me a little  
this is all your fault
how did you give birth to a child in my womb  
you are about to give birth to our child we are going to have a child
bye
ditto
are you ready
one two
 honey  hmm
i don't think i'm ready to be a mother
if i really had a child
if it changes me
but do you love me  
hmm
can't say that
if you change as a man
everything is messed up
i'm not kidding
but i
what kind of changes do you mean  
if ugly if great  
don't worry
they will not lose my love
we cannot be separated from them
are you scared
have you seen those movies  
in movies girls get big bellies and explode
boom blood everywhere in the room
everyone is screaming
i was joking
i promise there is a doctor who can calm you down
your baby is about one centimeter now
like a peanut
this is normal for an eightweekold baby
eight weeks   but now we know that he has a child
i had a patient who didn't even know she was pregnant
he thought he was fat
the work is done here
have more questions  
 what is it like to meet a child    it's up to you
a contraction is felt first
it's just how you feel during menses
but it hurts a hundred times more than that
if you have a caesarean we'll cut your stomach like this
then the baby is taken sutured and sent away
you can decide on a preferred date for the baby's birthday
but if you want a normal birth
you have to wait until the crack is big enough for a child to come out
all you have to do is push it out
it may take hours or just a few minutes
whoosh the baby is born
but the hardest part is
contractions
for example bleeding
vaginal fissures baby turns
small fallopian tubes can occur
at that time we
it definitely hurts
having a baby is painful especially when giving birth to you
i was very hurt and it's been a long time
i still can't believe it
but when your sister was born it happened quickly
i just pushed and here he is
exercise a lot during pregnancy
while i was having him i continued to exercise
walked a lot ate a lot
there was no trouble when i met ditto
eat this here i have blown this to sleep
these are made for you
don't think about vomiting in the morning
if it's like kalante throw up the food and eat again
how is this  
life
alive
i find out about this myself
asking others only scares me
no one said to listen to them
don't count them
everyone has their own experiences
a happy mother a good baby
we came alive
 life    i'll be in this
huh  
why  
don't you want to see me play come this far  
i don't feel right
then why did you come with me  
i want to support you
but from here
i don't understand
anything
alive
a little sleep would be nice wouldn't it   it's late
where are you going  
i have a concert in bali
the plane in a little while
 is it today    yes i will come soon
honey
 shall i come too    three days
don't leave me for a minute please
come on
 you're not ready yet  that's okay
huh  
 right   oh  okay
 go get ready  just wait
 what    give me three minutes
 give me the one for bali first  wait let me see
there are two seats in the plane together
we'll take it
 in business class    yes here
the total amount is eight times your previous fee
 is everything okay    sir  
ok here
here's your ticket your card
thank you
i will go first
hmm
alive let's go
 come on  i'll be here i'm tired
alive let's go get ready i'm already too late
why don't you spend some time with me  
then you can leave just in time to start
you said you support me but you are a nuisance at times
my energy is all gone
that's what you say in all my shows
get up you can let's go
are you saying get up  
do you think that i don't care about these differences between me and her  
 change the way you think  how  
these are hormones people who meet children are like this
not
you left everything behind
i know you are strong
stop worrying about yourself
ok
do you think i should do that  
whenever i feel upset and emotional
you think i won't fight  
now that you understand i'm fed up
if this is going to happen this kid is better off gone
 you  what about me  
you are crazy
he cannot be understood believe
there is no reason to be angry but he explodes
be patient few more months
so many months
do you think i will be spared when the child is born  
after the child is born schools have a big battle
it is the child who is fighting but the principal is talking to me
sorry mr johnny you know adopt the kid
my name is jules johnny is the boy's name
your life now belongs to the child
it's lonely without a single life isn't it  
you
when my wife had the baby
he's crazy like you
always changing
exercise together like yoga
i tried several times
but he has a million reasons to say no
you i understand
being a father is boring really
but when your hand hurts
do you massage it   cut and paste  
 must have a massage  that's right
same for ucha
greetings to you
life
i'm very sorry
please forgive me
i don't even know what i did wrong
do you remember why we fought  
it was a big fight right  
all the while you know…
when i got pregnant it was like this
i don't have any big passions
just being with you
if my pregnancy breaks our relationship
i don't want this kid never
shh
what are you reading  
we agreed
bear everything together
right  
but every time we fight you leave
after saying a few angry words he leaves the house
not
it's not like that
listen
i don't want to blow up in front of you
but it hurts me a lot leaving me
like i was rejected
what are you talking about  
no time i swear
never thought of such a thing
honey
one day we will have a bigger problem than today
maybe we both scream louder
but we both cannot leave the other
i will never leave you
does this mean you have forgiven me  
take a breath
keep
what are we saying a happy mother a relaxed child
now hold the partner's hands
ok raise the other hand and take it
breathe
keep

you
midwifery care mrs robin
your baby is fine
he is a strong child
barely enough
is he in trouble for something  
you stay at home today you need rest
keep negative things out of your mind
because a happy mother
a good child
listen
pregnancy is not only a mother's job
both work
everything you say think
your feelings also affect the baby
you love the baby
not just food
now
when was the last time you kissed  
is it good now  
my stomach
your feelings
do you think we are ready to be parents  
i don't want to give up
if the baby won't leave us we shouldn't leave the baby either
i can't promise you'll stop snapping
but i will always love you
i swear
alive
what is this
why are you crying again  
these are hormones
good
no matter what i love you
i know
shh
do not laugh
i don't count
13 years of friendship no lie
no matter how angry i am with him
he will never be taken as an enemy
this is something new
definitely
because the baby needs good nutrition
he needs love too
ah
are these for babies  
 for the big baby  okay
for the baby lying on the side of the road
my baby
what  
i love you
i didn't get a chance to say it
because a whole village was watching us
life
um  
it's been a long time finally we
just wait
according to the book there is no problem
it's hot inside
 i will swim  you
baby
you have a crazy father
but mom loves him
this person's whole life is drumming
however after marriage he played instruments less
even if it's only for a week
as a support to the wife
who is that he is here with his wife
ditto and armour
you look so fresh how was the trip to bali  
we did what all tourists do
went shopping walked on the beach climbed mountains
i was there all the time
he is lying
tell the truth   stayed in bed for a long time
it's like taking our home bed to bali
oh he seems to be complaining
he is having a baby
but why did you go to bali   there are many places to go in indonesia 
like majalengka cibodas cipanas
ah
bali is a special place for us
we have been there several times before
we have many memories there
he is talking like a westerner right now
we met a midwife
he helps us to have a normal baby
are you planning to go to bali to have a baby  
yes in bali with the help of the midwife
what is ditto   didn't you know  
 definitely  as a couple you talk
honey come here
bali  
no time
if anything happens you're on your own
who will help  
if you want a normal birth let's do it here in a hospital
i am not sick
i can't give birth in a hospital
we love bali
mrs robin will help us
that is the most important story
why are you asking for a normal birth  
it is not an easy task
don't be old fashioned
hey mom
we looked into this
he studied in america
the bali clinic is good
you are bored too
first look in jakarta
after all mrs robin is the best
we don't say anything
 i still want to have the baby in bali  i know
but let's get you checked out by a real doctor
is your throat sore  
you haven't looked at me like that in a while
in what way
i don't understand
after the baby comes into your life
your love for this chick has decreased
here
is that all  
as you said i looked at you
life do you want to do it  
it doesn't matter are you afraid of hurting the baby  
this is probably why pregnant women are looking for it
their hearts may not be strong
have you ever thought about someone else  
i don't have time for that do you know what's in my head  
like i don't know if he ate
what shall i bring him  
he looks tired need a massage  
thank you
for being patient with me
three more months
your everything is fine
you can give birth the way you want
 then we  but the best way is to do caesar
then you can decide the day and time of the child's birth
during the surgery you can also apply makeup as you like
 i can't  and we have good fast wifi nearby
dad can watch live wherever he is in the world
even during surgery
 doctor  yes
thanks for the help
a trifle

during the last weeks of pregnancy
the baby has to turn to come out

that is the way to have a baby without surgery
anyway your baby
what do you say
my baby has not turned  
for extra caution i suggest a caesarean
but is there no other way  
hello life
what did the doctor say

why did you suddenly change your mind  
in a normal birth the baby is not turned
caesar i'm afraid
but you have to
calm down

don't think negative things
what if you call the baby and ask  
tell him to be good

the first truck is broken it is now under construction
there's something right  
why don't you go we will take care of this
i know you do i have to sign the bill right  
sign up now i'll give it to you when i'm done
ok then
thanks bro
but call me when you're done
ok boss will talk
 many newspapers have headlines but i know
everyone is waiting to see what happens to clark
it's a space comet
scientists say that this is the closest comet to our earth
that means we can take care of this even during the day
 that's great  yes
they found this out a few weeks ago
nasa says that this is likely to have come from another planet
this is just
 you scared me  sorry
what time is it now i thought it was coming at 7:00
my work finished early
 i'll be downstairs if you say so  that's okay
i'm done
how much is it  
 five  five is great
is there a party tomorrow  
are you kidding
nathan has already told half the province
how is he
he is fine
how long will it be difficult  
i don't know john i'm not doing this
because you're only doing this because of nathan
not so not like that
not like that
ok
i just asked
it will take some time
both of us need hard work
we can do this allie
ok i'll take a shower
i will call deb and tell her to come home
 does he remember to wash his hands after he comes    okay
thank you
hey
father
 i'm glad you came home  me too
do you still like this table  
yes i can dress nice in this
i can see that
i like this come here
god you are a talented artist
thank you
 so how is school    good
do your teachers talk about this  
yes sir william says that clark is made of gases
wow
asteroids are made of air realized
not clark is a comet not an asteroid
ah a comet i didn't know they were different
comets go fast very loud
did you know that clark is from another planet  
that's why no one could know about this before
i know two things
what  
you and the comet are said to be made of air
no you
no you come here
how is your gadget  
 is medicine better than injections    very good
really  
good
what's wrong baby
will mom send you home again  
your mother and i have something to settle
whatever it is
look at this son
i will always be your father right  
i will never leave you
i love you baby
scientists continue to study clark
about the comet discovered in the last few weeks
more than many comets more than asteroids
since it moves slowly the trajectory is easy to track
this comet is not one piece
it is made of thousands of pieces of rock and ice
they were broken millions of years ago
on the other hand clark's tail is quite long
the end of the tail is longer than scientists have ever seen
in other words on wall street
nathan do the homework
can i help
ok what do we have   fractions
 i thought you were good at math  i don't like fractions
they are difficult
it's okay if they're hard because math and fractions are very important
do you think dad can build big buildings without math  
 do you want to build tall buildings like me    yes
come on i will help
ok what shape is divided into equal parts  
it is the guest room
 great binoculars  i can't see clark
maybe he's still asleep
father
 the latest situation
some of clark's larger pieces may have entered the atmosphere
according to scientists when the larger particles get closer to the sun
their temperature increases and gases are released because of this their trajectories change
and they say don't worry about it these cannot come to earth
as they pass through the atmosphere they burn and perish
let me be clear this is going to be a big show
hey john glad to be back man
 hey ed how are your    good
 how is the problem    good
 it's coming in the evening isn't it    i never pass up a free meal
i know that
see you later
hey looks like we need more beer and wine
can you come to the store   the group will be here in an hour
 now   i just started cooking  i have to get ready
the group will also come now
ok ok
need something else   going to the store anyway
not
ok
actually bring some hotdog buns
more mustard we only have the spicy one
thank you
ok kids
give me a toy  
if you hear what you say
wow
where did these come from  
i don't know
that there's clark
wow
sounds pretty doesn't it  
ok let's hurry
hey nathan come on
ok let's get stuff
let's get some drink packets too
ok
ok
drink
what do you like
i love these
ok then this nation
it's loud what is that
like an emergency notification
a presidential notice  
hello  
this is a presidential announcement this is not a rehearsal
john alan garrity
you have been selected the emergency care camp
allison rose garrity with you
nathan beckett garrity
you are only allowed one piece of luggage nothing else is possible
please prepare alison rose garrity
nathan beckett garrity
stay tuned for more information
this is not a rehearsal
okay nathan let's go now
 you said you were giving a toy  let's do it next time
that's right this is a rare experience
 here they come  great time
sit down here
hi hi
hey
john nice to see too bro
you too kenny hey deb
hey honey
these are heading towards atlanta
you came at the right time the first piece is about to fall now
 is clark going to hit    a small piece of it
don't worry it falls into the sea
dad come sit down
ok i will talk to mom a bit
hey
 where's the beer and wine    in the car
listen to this i just received a presidential notice did you come too  
not maybe it was a rehearsal bringing things in  
no ali this cannot be training
they said that our family has been selected for a detention camp
i think there is something wrong with this comet
but the news was told that bermuda is exactly where the pieces fall
then why half of our military planes are in the air  
how many flights are going now  
hey john here come and see
in a few moments a fraction will fall near bermuda
many scientists say the distance of shock waves
literally it's like a tsunami
but we feel it much more than the tunguska incident of 1908
an asteroid hit the earth
 that there's clark  isn't it cool  
here is the first line
would you like to see this   these are the live views we are getting now
this part actually enters the lower atmosphere
five four
three two
one
collision
wait where is the explosion  
this is a small stone stones do not explode
tell that to the dinosaurs
we are still waiting for the first glimpses
this part actually fell into the atlantic ocean
 what is it   the first glimpses show
nathan come here
is everyone ok
what is that are you all good  
i think it's a shock wave
we now know that fallen part
it's down to central florida
as for the midpoint of the collision it is known to be near tampa
from to orlando
that part
as big as a football field scientists estimate
about 1500 people have felt the shock caused by it
i warn you the visions you are about to see may be terrifying
these are difficult terrifying visions to behold
we get these from a local news helicopter
by now weather satellites are down
 wow  what  
mike turn mike back
my goodness
are there more pieces to collide  
we're sorry beyond these glimpses no further information is available at this time
unfortunately we have lost contact with our correspondent in that area
what is that john
this is a presidential announcement
there are errors in the trajectories of these parts
why only come to your phone without us  
this announcement
john alan garrity to the
you have been selected for the emergency care camp
dad your name is on tv
with you is alison rose garrity nathan beckett garrity
no one else is allowed no other permission
bring one bag
robin to air force base warner robins is located in georgia
before 9:45 pm in normal time
the phone has received a qr code to identify you
confirm with number one that you received it
perhaps the message has reached our home as well
but why only came to john's phone  
show the qr code to robin air force base
before 21:45 for entry permit
another one is going to hit us i found out
let's go let's go
i'll be with nathan
 let's go ellie  mother
let's go out let's go out
unfortunately we don't have any more information about this
turn to these shown darshans our relationship
they said it was only one bag what do we take   cold or hot  
i don't know get it right for both
 where is his insulin    hand top left corner
remembering to take the medicine from the refrigerator
 will these occur in a month    for a month  
we'll have to prepare for a year ally
honey hey hey look at this everything is fine
we're going fast because we can't miss the plane
let's go on that journey everyone is together
ok honey
and grandfather  
hey let's talk to him right  
after the tampa incident by calculation
my goodness
about 400000 people were alive
everything was taken from the top floor we have a great journey
give me the bag put the insulin
give me the bag here
where is nathan was it with you  
the damage done is unimaginable
nathan
nathan come here let's go
see the sky is on fire
ok let's go honey come on
is everything ok
ok
we can see it here
john john john
my goodness
they have not been spoken to
it's two days everything is wrong
a lot of pieces are going to fall for us
as they say one of them can destroy the earth
they have stopped all regular flights what are we doing  
i don't know ed
come on
i don't even know if this refugee camp is real
these are nonsense you knew
sorry i'm very sorry
call us if you know anything
where is the safe place  
i'll do it ed
have a nice trip
wait
wait
stop
my goodness
stop
wait stop john
wait
take eli please
please
we can't take him deb
just take ellie
 let's take him  no ali we can't move
eli i'm very sorry
we can't move
i will hit you
deb for god's sake quit
 john  alley
do not
we can't take
 do not coward  deb i'm sorry
do not john
alison allison
please open the door
i'm sorry deb
do not
what would he do if he was nathan  
nathan
eli
do not
i'm sorry kenny
do not
do not
wait john let's go back
ali we can't take him
 why not    what  
although we took him to the army camp
do you mean leave him there when they reject eli  
he speaks
everything is fine
while more collisions are expected around the world
due to the rotation of the earth
the wedding phone does not ring dad is fine isn't he  
with explosions millions of calls
circulates therefore many people have to stay longer
all over the country people have come to the shops to buy goods
for collection
it has not increased
according to unconfirmed reports people have received calls from the president
it has been said to go to military bases located in different places
they are said to be referred to as the chosen ones and sent to a detention camp
 does this say where we are being taken    not
in this the locations of the detention camps are secret no other information
i don't understand why we were chosen
still no official notification
from the white house or the department of defense
what's happening  
most people approve of keeping information hidden
to stop people from rioting
then this selected group can be directed to the care camps first
before our nation completely collapses
hey
great
that highway
my goodness
be careful what are you doing
let's go another way
be careful
 come on john  sorry ally
ok
ok
i think it's okay
clark's shares are now estimated to be in the thousands
these are likely to land in different places in the world
that without any awareness
most of them are small in size and do less damage
some parts are large enough to destroy a city
just like bogota was destroyed a few minutes ago
 but the space agencies as they say  finally
they try their best to collect details in one section
because largescale destruction can be done from that part
this large chunk will collide with earth within the next 48 hours
my goodness
local police agencies and first responders have been devastated…
do you think that all these people are the chosen ones  
i do not know
what would happen if all these people were not allowed to go  
let's go and see first
 jump ok  let's go now

# from junglecruise(2021)sinhalasubtitlesrt
all legends are born from reality
from amazon
and so the legend of moon tears
a single small branch of a great tree
heals any disease removes any curse
centuries
many explorers have discovered
legendary healing tears
some were not known
as far as the quest of don lope de agari
he was someone who had really taken the power of tears
but the forest protected the tears
history bears witness to the failure of his quest
but there are more legends
the tree guards have found him
they revived him
he has requested to grant his holiness
because it can find moonshine
agari attacked
but the forest fought back
agari and his explorers were taken away
cursed never leave the sight of the river
run or die
or legends exist
we know they disappeared here
in the shrine of tears
it is here that we find the truth of the legend
a plant with unparalleled healing powers
my wise friend
i confirm the famous legend
that it is not an illusion involving moon tears
 but scientific fact  but scientific fact
modern medicine can completely change
diseases can be cured not only in our cities
even our soldiers torn to pieces by german shells
i have come here today to take special care of you
among them lies an ancient god
recently discovered by dr albert's explorations
that head represents missing information
that information is very spot on
stop and act
moon tears
mr horton your request has been made
the answer is basically
 no  that's right
our preserves are only for noble scientists
if all else fails read this carefully 
if all else fails read this first
 not for beginners  that's right if all else fails read this first
 not for beginners  that's right
it stayed that way while you had your attention
will you allow me to continue mine  
analysis how important
moonshine to modern medicine  
 hello  hello
 shaka zulu  yes
with one simple new fold
he conquered all enemies
it says so but the rounding effect
you are not in the right place

shut your mouth
hey hey

things others like or dislike
sh
axel i think he ran away

the main thing for germany to win this war is tree

 what are you doing    we can't beat it
frank
ah
look what they did to you poor boat
i'm very sorry machine guns
who brings submarines to the amazon  
but you beat them all the time
i thought i was normal
you seem too much this time
do we know who the madman from the submarine is  
not i don't know his name
but he was kaiser wilhelm's youngest son
several articles have been written about moonlight
i think it should be him
don't you like that dress  
not a bit
my eyes are also sweaty
are you ok honey
oh my god mcgregor look
my goodness mcgregor look out
amazon dolphins
how beautiful
you know here we call them attractions
 attraction    yes shapeshifting souls
don't look directly into their eyes if you don't want bad dreams
you believe in legends then believe in curses
ok
hey mcgregor
once upon a time there was a girl vaparai he didn't feel well
we could never see eye to eye
god is that your joke  
it's not a joke
i'm pretty sure he's looking sideways at someone else
stupid
you know a lot of people smile on camera frank
this is a moving picture camera
haven't you seen this before  
i have never seen a moving picture camera
it's a lot of fun
and it feels like being anywhere in the world
ah
still why would anyone want to
if you have to stay here surrounded by these  
it's just
this is like walking in the garden of eden
very beautiful
look at these did you see this heliconia  
you know there's one thing here
too much for one tree
mcgregor i think you're leading us down the wrong path
we have to go that way
not no problem go like this
the tear crystal is on that side
 frank frank  he's right
i think you are wrong
i'm not wrong i am the captain
the tear crystal is directly there
go ahead
frank that's how it is on the map
here is the mountain exactly this debokkava
if we go this way we have two days left
we can't go that way we have to go this way
the tear crystal is on this side
from that side the river is rough have you ever been on a river rally  
no but i think you
 yes  that's why i got you
so
turn that way to the right
i don't know how to swim
don't worry about it kappo
miss captain
my mistake
this hopelessly endless amazon
an infinite number of tangled tributaries
dr horton and ehisa are somewhere now
there is only one
went close to the moon
let's ask him directly let's go on a new path
but my lord the curse of don agari
it's just a legend right  
let's stop here for tonight
can't we go a long way in the dark   let's go straight
can't the engine cannot be overheated
say something captain after this day
i would really like to try your luxurious bath
is that down here  
 not can't swim here pants  what  
there is a place to take a bath that's the place
a 4300squarefoot pool
i warmed up a little for you
ah i know you don't want to swim so if you sink there
go and wash yourself well and come ashore and take a bath
if i have something to eat
someone threw all my food in the harbor
you know frank if you're trying to stop our tour by hooking us up
let me tell you it works just fine
are you telling me to eat this  
ah
piranha
better eat them before they eat you
no time
gotta say frank these piranhas are awesome
there is no other place that tastes like this
that's blood
ah
ok
i sleep
sleep where you like downstairs my room is forbidden
which one am i going for  
wow
the troublemaker
how can i stop your goat  
i'm not used to seeing a woman wearing pants that is all
don't worry about my clothes
look the other way
you know you really brought those eyes to life
your view is a bit strange
what  
as a nuisance you are right
 do you dress    drawn earlier
why did you stop  
i wore everything i wanted to wear
then thought learn something new
or you need some good inspiration
what about you
there is no end to inspiration
i mean what are you doing here  
follow maps everywhere   or is this the way to have fun  
 moon tears  come on
i believe that legend is true
 not so  i'll find it
 can't find it  when i did
just think how many lives will be saved
legend has it that a leaf of that tree cures any disease
it will change the medicine
it will be the beginning of a new scientific revolution
that's very refreshing frank
so you want to be the darwin of flowers  
and i want to help as many people as possible
want to save the world  
i didn't say save the world
that is great
 thank you  that's so stupid
you are very unpleasant
and different
then you put your and your brother's lives at risk
save people you don't even know  
you don't need to know someone to see
i don't want to think about anyone
it can be seen
i think you are lucky
to have someone who cares about you
i've had enough of that world
i've had enough of that world
hmm
my goodness my god
mcgregor
proxima proxima
come here proxima
calm down
proxima
is this your cat
and that battle  
 he lied  oh my god frank
is there one thing i can trust about you  
there is none
perfect time
the locals talk about this place with horror
this is where agari and the people were punished
for trying to steal ehisa
here
the water of the house
this is what you were waiting for
look who came
the legend has come true
the water of the house want more  
a long painful wait for the water to come
moon tears can remove your curse
free from the jungle
you want what i want
exploding
ehisa is nearby
find it for me
we both get what we want do you agree
swear
good
look who's having nightmares
ok we are now going through a turbulent river are the pants ready  
are you sure this is the way  
you chose the path you saved two days
is the chaos just a metaphor  
if you have valuables
it's better to be downstairs
i'll see you on the other side because i think i'm worth it
hang on mcgregor wait wait
don't lose this
did you see that
you must bring it to me
nice to meet you
do not say that
go
you again get out of here
are you sure you're ready for this  
captain ride the boat
that stupid cat
 what do you do    he's everywhere
here goes
my goodness
are you ok ma'am
 i'm fine  want to go back  
not just started
good me too
hello
want to go back  
keep going
it looks like the pants are wet
get wet
give up now
drop the guitar too
my goodness
come on baby
let's go
please don't do it again
i had to turn the boat back and go to town how so  
the only brainy story you've told since we met
how are you pants
ready to go back to town  
not  
i love this experience
i feel happy
you look a little green
that's why i'm asking are you ok
are you hungry
yes he is hungry
if you like let's eat some good piranhas
you did well
did you get it
ah
are you drunk
you are the sweetest cat i've ever had
i don't know how you are with him
i've only been with him for two days and now i want to throw him in the water
it will take some getting used to
will he ever stop  
 lily    yes
no time
understand when going down
this must be his latin emblem
(in latin)
hmm
what are you doing
your funeral
just looking a bit
your sister says what she wants to say
that he will tell anyone
don't care about anyone's feelings
it doesn't matter who gets hurt usually for me
he is making me after our father
dad always went after weird ideas
there is no such thing as a curse
and no emperor has come here for three centuries
hmm
then why did you follow him here  
this is my third time presenting
a wellmatched marriage
a beautiful educated woman can ride well on a horse
but i had to ask the woman
i can't accept it
no suggestion
my wish is
somewhere else
somewhere else  
somewhere else
haha
ok somewhere else
my uncle threatened to expel me
friends family turned their backs on me
all because of the person i loved
i could have been exiled from society
if not for lily
he was there for me
for that i will follow him to a volcano
pants let's go now
can you describe this  
i said the room is forbidden
i'm sure you said
then you can keep secrets from us
lies upon lies i mean frank you look like a fake onion
 what lies    you follow it too
i'm not going after it anymore
it's been a long time
ok
like you i came here looking for moonshine
like you i had maps
about a dozen more
agari the artist drew many maps
his life was lost because of something that could not be found
i went to every village every island every sand after the legend
nothing
i've been stuck in this house ever since
wishing to go somewhere other than here
but you didn't have this
i'm petting you now don't eat me
got it
calm down
trying to do now
you're not as bad as you look right  
i have never been rejected so quickly
lily
mcgregor
ah
where is this taking us  
this takes us to the land of the head hunters
it's not a good place to go
ah frank not now
i can't stop it
lily
frank
frank
mcgregor
what did you say
i mean release you and your brother and let them live
for that put your all in clothes…
i stay here too
that is very brave
i don't agree with that we don't do that
there is no way for the three of us to escape from this situation
i know them now leave to them
 no  can i speak for five minutes  
without your distractions  
now you are done
oh no
all we want from you
 ehisa  do not
don't shake your head like that they don't like it
they don't like it do not do that
i know you've got it
it belongs to my people it was taken before
give it up and go back
or be tormented by your fingers
then it is cleaned and used for meat
ah
come on you heard what minimus kanna said
 hand it over  i'm a little weak
to pooka michuna language
so you translate what i say every word
ok
can't i can't give up
 god lily  lily
shut up say
ok i have ehisa belongs to your group
he reads nonsense about ehisa
i'll hand it over
he is very difficult
but first i need to use it to find moonshine
it's hard to keep it close to him
now though i would die for it it did
he doesn't care even if you kill him
but you have to let these two go
don't just kill me
lily
come and fight fighting
go do what happened
lily
really frank
next time i will charge more for this nonsense
sam we have an agreement don't we  
no no i'm fed up having done this nonsense
wearing these ridiculous clothes
you told me
he is a good english speaker with a weak brother
that he is going to die
i know because he's crazy
he is crazy stubborn
lily the truth is i didn't get a chance to tell you to stop
remember if you get scammed it's just a scam
you have to stop that
 weak huh    strongly
a strong shot the whole family is the same
can it be translated  
may be
most of the time there are some obstacles
english improves when you need something
i have a great idea to talk as much as we can
you can
sam likes to trade
i'm thinking
 do you like this hat    hmm
you keep it
you really did it
 do you think he will    can't imagine
it's not personal it's something we've talked about before
if you do that to lily you will be treated as dead
as if dead and buried
buried
 smelted and buried  i understand
 dead as a dodo bird  you are too obvious
 dead dead  mcgregor
this beer is too good
 this is masato  hmm
this is made from fermented saliva
you drink saliva
when he went to rome
god if i went to rome
moon tears
everything has a healing power
in this word
there is no very english word for this
a pain
a soul
a cure
a healing of the soul
a lot of times
hmmm a cure
to prove your worth you must turn water to stone
then join the broken heart
ah
if tears fall
the great tree must be under the rare weeping moon
there will be one in a couple of days
the tree hides
on the blood of the heart
it sank to the west over the serpent's heart
of the serpent
where the grass eats its own tail
the place where he eats his own tail from the grass god
let me tell you it's complicated
surely no one has found it
ok because it is not in the tear crystal area
it's here in the broken moon area
ok
how long do you think it will take me to get there  
two or three days
if the thumb goes through  
sorry  
please tell the captain that i will be traveling alone from now on
you can't do it alone lily
please tell him he has misunderstood my determination and driving ability
please tell dr kalisamy what is in this jungle
about many things that are not in any book that he has read before say
i will not fall for his stupid tricks anymore
they are really bored
if you go up the river alone with that thing around your neck
 you don't get to come back alive  really  
we need to be together
 is it    yes that's right
we is a great word frank
because it also speaks about trust and honesty
you don't know about any of that because you're a liar
you selfish arrogant
i don't trust you anymore i could throw you away
not really far because you are so big
then there really is no such thing as we
and here's your remaining 12000
here's a little shout out to your awesome service
this is a show
dakkuwa
ok this is used for more than 200 yards
at less than that you need an iron
war paint   ok
to a war hero
whipping
this doesn't seem to go away
because that tattoo ink will leave in a while
in a few decades
come on
francisco

this forest is swallowing our souls

please
dr horton right

frank would you like to bite my stick  
 no i'm fine thank you  not to pain
i understand what
what he says but don't
here it is if you want
i just feel you are too straight
it's not easy for me because i'm nervous
anxiety is normal this is your first time
 ah  this is your first time isn't it  
 yes you know that  i know i can tell
i have done this a hundred times
 i don't know how to get it  this is special
 is it    yes
 hern  what  
you can't do that
 it's hard that way  frank
do you like to crawl like a worm  
 ok ok  not at all
i can twist the back and give it a little push
 not no problem  okay
do you know something that would help    if your leg is on top
 i'm a little nervous  don't worry
frank i'm counting to three
are you making do i count
not i count
 one  ah
i had a dream eating lunch in the city
hey doctor
 let's go now  of course
not enough of what you did
i can't send you alone
look at your situation you can't even walk
are you thinking about going back  
i don't mind i promise
do i smell  
dangerously
we have guests
good evening my friend
is there something here  
what's up did you find his boat  
not  
not the boat   is it left  
right   ok show me where
we take orders from the bees
show me on the map
here  
ok did you hear change the path
can you ask the bees for coordinates  
don't joke axel
thank you thank you
395 years
5 months 13 days
i really thought you were dead
will i be sad if i die  
i think a lot
about my soul
about my quest
about you
who are you
you are not bleeding i think breathing
you can't be
i don't even know who i am
but let me tell you who first
my father is a merchant
agari's father took him to work
i went to take care of him and when my father died he took me
agari and i grew up together like brothers
agari's daughter anna fell ill
he only had a daughter he promised to save
i go far
but i will come back with moon tears
then you run out of the moon again
got well
we fought in the sea before coming to the river
the forest fought at our every step
i was going to do anything to find the moon
save agari's daughter
amazon also got on the map
are you agari's mapper  
did you draw my map  
frank
do you really think my work is bad  
i think you were a genius in your day
minor  
one by one the jungle caught us
but we didn't die agari could not go back
he could not imagine a world without his daughter
then they came
we would all die that day if they didn't save us from the moonshine
the power of that flame is real
the leader and his daughter took that power out
everything was broken the stem was melted
suddenly we came alive
agari is very happy
because he is very close to finding a cure for his daughter
but he lost his patience
agari urges them to give ehisa
take him to the tree
you're not worth it
the leader refused
forgetting the kindness they showed us
he started killing everyone
he has a big head
i love agari but i just couldn't join the craze
i won't bother you
i just want the head
i couldn't wait
give me that
run
do not
a brother's sword cuts deep
traitor
the leader knew that this was his last breath
he protected his head with that breath
and their sacred tree
he cursed agari
all of us were cursed so that we could not go beyond the edge of the river
 where did he go    can't go too far
or the forest drags us back
agari hated me for betraying him
he found me several times fought
he fought again
i was tired of being stabbed by the sword
therefore a task was arranged so that none of them would be disturbed
they were locked in a cave
the river
where is it
where the forest cannot take them back to the river
we have to escape from here
francisco this will pay
for 300 years the forest held their bodies
they have become the demons they are now
i don't know how they escaped
but i was careful for a long time
what did you do
i did good things i built a city
it's fun
met friends
some people lost
that's when i thought go find moonshine
i built a boat
i named it kuila after the moon god
i walked every inch of it
finally gave up
since i can't go where i can see the river
i started giving tours
so long alone
not really alone
that's right
during this time i wanted someone
next after him again again
so proxima proxima
 proxima    proxima yes
 i named everyone proxima  ah proxima
don't worry you are my favorite girl
theran theran theran theran
life is not a dream
you should join in the second one
i will do it again right

hello

we finally met
wow big strong boy
go to the bridge go
i think this is yours
now let's go
no no no no
a woman who thinks like this
find moonshine and share it with science societies
they don't even count you they don't even sit next to you
that's amazing power
it would be crazy to give so many people
i can use tears not only for wars
control future generations too
take them
looking forward go to the side of the tree
this tree is dead
you know more about moonshine than anyone else
you know how this goes do it now
after you get what you want
how to stop killing us  
i can kill you now
i will do that
if you promise to let them go if you give me one piece
i know about these ancient stories as if i lived at that time
frank don't
if anyone here is taking moon tears it's just me
if you can open this tree you will get a branch
take my word for it
there is no other way
but the little boy will stay in the boat
little brother i have a name
wow this is beautiful
go ahead
the left head should fit here
 you go and help  no
huh  
i'll do it too if i'm given a chance
if i give you a piece too
one branch can't do two you choose
what do you think giant  
would you pay for him  
i will have to be killed first
eh  
 okay  okay
broken heart
climb to the highest place
shoot the moon with his arrow
from there the moon will know true pain and mourn
tears will fall and the sacred tree will sprout
rumpumpumpum
(a german folk song)
give me the arrow
quickly
sam said we need to mend our broken hearts
this is not a head this is a heart
you can't love a heart
if not broken
i will take the dal now
beneath the crying heart
before the moon sets we must break the stalk
all the time

i am in front of you to tell you about moon tears
the legend is true
our team went deep into the amazon a distance no explorer had gone before
on our journey between life and death
past and present vanished
i saw unbelievable things
the magical dolphin can control one's dreams
undead explorers
for 400 years trapped in the forest by a curse
a tribe ruled by a woman
not it went very well
i mean it's a trip
this society has never seen before
a very important adventure for this association
but should this association know about our adventure  
look we didn't go looking for moonshine
so we can write a book
a lot of nonsense is included
my sister a professor at cambridge university
i was asked to respectfully decline
your membership request for him
i am doing it now not respectfully
gentlemen you may take the invitation
show your association

i couldn't grow up like you guys
it was in the beginning but the world was destroyed
i don't think anyone was surprised
we always hoped it would it finally happened
but how did it happen   it's a bit of an interesting case
616 agatha
yes it's an asteroid came directly to earth
i know that's normal
so the whole world came together we did the best we could
we sent a lot of rockets towards it
we blew it that's great
but it didn't happen make rockets out of them
a stack of rasana material came out
they came back to earth like rain everything changed
all told the world's coldblooded animals
and what changed was that the genes mutated and ate us
ants slugs crocodiles tell yourselves many animals
i know a kid who died in his sleep after eating a goldfish
todd loved the goldfish
next is the cat
many people in history kill a cockroach
just a slipper
now you need a gun
maybe a battle tank
maybe that won't work either
especially if you weren't inside the battle tank
gradually many large animals and our army dwindled
about 95% of the population was lost in a year
a very large amount
a lot of people
those who survived however hid everywhere
bunkers caves underground rooms all over the world
so for the past seven years i've been in an underground bunker
it's not as complicated as it seems really
there is a good team here we all love each other
just like i imagined college life
are you sure he's asleep  
who
 joel who else  yes he is sleeping
 just wait shh  he didn't get up
 are you sure    it's your mind
i just
joel joel
did you see he didn't get up
that's your mind
dear amy i was awake
i knew better not to move not to breathe
trapped with many people in a bunker to save lives
everyone's friend is not as good as they thought
karen and ray got together a few months ago
so they're still there like they're on their honeymoon
that's great
good for them they are both very beautiful and flexible
hey life is short especially while here
 ah hey those  hey joel
 how is joel    good tim
 how are you    they are good
great
 i can't sleep  we know that feeling
maybe not for the same reason
your door is open did you know that  
 yes  yes we know
ok
after tim's parents ate some insects
 it was impossible to separate it and them  okay good night
 by all means  good night
this is the 616 agatha they said
these are the chemical bombs they sent
almost everyone here was friends
we had our first baby in the winter it's very emotional
welcome to the new world
food is the last at least you don't know what's missing
after carol died carla and connor got together
carol is a cow who ate a packet of laundry detergent
now we have only one cow
her name is gertie
gertie is great
not only gertie but our food media
we had a hunting party bring dadu
everything they can
at first it was very easy but then we ran out of bullets
when we have to face such an animal with a weapon of our own making
it's not easy
or so they said
i don't go hunting
they want me in the kitchen i'm kind of
bunker cook
everyone loves the minestrone i make
i was the only person in the bunker who could do such a thing
i'm talking to mavis
he is not able to speak now
his battery is dead just like the other mavis
i've never actually seen one work
i wish you were here
i would like to meet people here

i have never met a survivor from fairfield
that's where it all started
shik i had only heard scary stories
it's so confusing
your parents
ah no
i was the only one left
they could not be saved
think it's your fault  
hmm
you are from fairfield
you are not supposed to be here
you have survived more than i thought
that was the best thing anyone ever said to me
that's a good start
keep it up a book like this can save someone's life
thanks clyde
you
is that girl really worth it  
did you come this far  
yes
yes he is worth it
don't stay in one place joel
he's right
don't be like that
even in the end of the world
ok now is the time to go
ah
second lesson
either a hot meal or a good night's sleep
 not both  not both
really  
some animal has dropped this food and will be here within an hour
why didn't you say that earlier   i did neither
i can't say everything
i'll kill you joel dawson i'll eat you like cabbage
i'm joel i can't even save the girl
because i'm a goodfornothing little boy
but you save me i thought you loved me
but i can't because
 what    that's your girl dying
 what    a needle in the middle of water
a stick that goes in the water a stick that goes in the water
wow ok did you see  
ah
have you met someone to say well  
let's go now
ok
come come let's go
mino   what do you do  
dear amy i have found friends
human friends
they taught me many things
lesson three: don't take shortcuts
lesson eight: practice hard every day
i know how to have fun now
 did you see    very good
lesson ten: always dry your socks that's great
i'm still a little confused the second lesson not both
it's very difficult
not both not both
come on joel not both
i am very tired
there are many things here which are not good to touch or eat
but these plants have detoxification properties
if eaten by a snake or a poisonous animal this is good
 it's worth putting it in the book  okay wrote
like insects they cannot see around
can't see around
lizards cannot climb
amphibians prefer to hide and catch food
and the sand diggers
they are the ones who are so bored
those who were bored
i know that i fell for it
you saw that worker bee
always beware of the queen
how do i know it's the queen  
the first thing is two big or small everything will be cut
every feeling is chased away
you scream in pain
then you will be torn apart
i will remember that
now we have come to the parting point
you want to go west on the jenner beach side
or will you go to the mountains with us after breaking your brain  
i think my whole life i have thought too much
it didn't help
come with us the more people the more security
besides we are a good team
i think so too but
i have something to do
that's not fair
hey
wow wow wow what is this  
why are you leaving  
because this girl is very important to me
i am doing this we talked about this
hey do you know i have something for you
i don't know if you will like this
lip balm  
ah
 what    yes
those lips
come on
i take back what i said earlier
amy will love you
thank you mino you've got it
ok
ok come on
the last lesson
listen to your heart out there
you can live with it
what if my mind is always confused  
you will die
good decisions can only be made when mistakes are made
if you're lucky make a few mistakes and live
you won't have any trouble
this will help you
wow
this is great
do you have more of these  
you are given only one
pull the pin take it to five not at four not at six
five
ok
you will be fine

i don't think it's stupid
that's lovely
ok see you understand
lovely it's
don't give up on your goal joel
when you see him he will be happy for the sacrifice you have made
you will understand it from your journey
also will like your kind and leadership qualities
thanks mavis
it can also happen like this amy can't see those qualities of yours
then you have come this far
just to make you sad
you'll probably learn a lot along the way

we found a special fuel deposit really met rocco

a 10 ton force tied to the front of the ship
he is sleeping now

ok
my name is joel dawson
i am 24 years old i lived on land for seven days
twice actually
 joel    joel  
how
my goodness
i live by the kindness of two visitors
and because of the kindness of a dog
i and my people from koloniya started traveling to the mountains
there are few dangerous animals
don't get me wrong the surface of the earth is a dangerous place
but i don't think hiding underground is the only answer
we have a big beautiful world
you may think it is impossible it is wrong
if i can protect the surface everyone can
a good friend of mine once said
good decisions are made by making mistakes
if you're lucky live after a few mistakes
you won't have any trouble
in this recorded speech i have everything i know about the world
learned many things the hard way
i hope you will learn easily from this
so take the cave door
ok come on
breathe good air enjoy life
it won't be easy but it's worth it
i went about 85 miles to see what was lost underground
they have always been on top of my head
they are great
one more thing don't stay in one place
no need to do that even in the end of the world
i spoke to you
joel dawson
translated and subtitled by nilusha hemal alahakon

it's a long journey baby i hope you know what you are doing

we are the guardians of friendship
with the power of friendship and the power of magic we
 let's share the love  let's hug
 let's destroy the brain  huh  
wait what
yes i am a unicorn we are evil
i destroy every pony by sending lasers from my horn
no no no it is wrong all the ponies
must join remember  
getting bored
just like back in the day when all three ponies were together
it started again
they never used magic to attack each other
 you are wrong  not not so
my mother used to say that the pegasails and unicorns tried to eat the earth ponies
they burned us with their lasers
they don't do that
so the earth ponies have lost their war
if they come back to maritime bay
we kick their ass and drive away
those are lies hitch tell him
our history teachers also told a similar story but
if you like let's continue the game your way sunny
 i don't mind  i'm confused
this is a boring game let's play pegasi bbq
sprout stop
 earth pony burger  i tell dad
 battle of the horns  you break it
look there earth pony
father tell them they are not
don't you think it's time to go home now kids  
ah ok

come on my brain is melting
 mother    hello mrs cloverleaf
how many times have i said it   you can't go around
especially here without my permission
can you tell me why phyllis  
because you are changing their brains
from your nonsense
call it research phyllis
and all that brainchanging work
i give you
unicorn cupcakes  
just made
ah you know you're an earth pony
you should act like it even for him
who do you think he is to call me like that  
that pony is in trouble
don't worry mom when i became sheriff
i will keep everything in order
hmmm sheriff sprout it suits you perfectly
what happened sunny  
hitch and sprout still don't believe me
one day they will believe
but most importantly stand up for what you believe in
right  
when i grow up i show everyone that you're right
 huh    yes
someday we will both meet unicorns and pegasuses
we will be best friends
maybe today will be that day
look at that unicorn
where is   where is    
here here
 catch up  wee
 i'm sweeping the sky  yeeha
wait dad i have an idea
dear unicorn and pegasi
you have a friend in maritime bay come and see us
shall we send this  
i think that's good
 can you tell me the story    again  
please
once upon a time many moons ago in equestria of yesteryear
 lived special  unicorn
that unicorn is so bright
just like the sun
one day the princess invited him to the palace
assign a special task
 learn about friendship  hmmm
he quickly made many friends
earth ponies pegasails unicorns
together they showed each pony the magic of friendship
they lived happily
wow you made it
isn't it beautiful  
the earth ponies stared in amazement
when pegasails make rainbows across the sky
the night sky lit up with unicorn lights
it's beautiful
oh i wish i had a friend who could fly and move things
why can't we be friends anymore  
that's the big question honey
maybe one day we will find the answer
let's do our part
from the heart
good night dad
good night little ponies
good night friends
great
today is the day father this time i have a better plan
wish me luck
 good morning sun 
 no time to talk gotta run 
 because i have to go somewhere 
 there's a lot of work 
 worried nervous 
 a change begins with me 
 i never worried about stone hearts 
 or match me   
 i've heard it happen 
 i think they're lying 
 i'm never lost 
 there's something inside that's more than pride 
 shows the shiny way out of me 
 maybe maybe that's my dad 
 be my day 
 maybe maybe it's my day 
 maybe maybe it's my day 
 make my day 
 make my day 
 hey hello 
 friends i make friends i know 
 listen to my story today 
 instead of hiding instead of being stuck inside

the law is the law
i'm here to protect it be careful ponies

hey extend it carefully
 why    this is i
i don't want to be grayed out by the lasers coming from it
you already know that
you must have read my mind all this time
it's got to be shiny right  
or does it happen when you step on things  
really
wait don't answer now wait until you get my book
ok wow
142 questions to ask a unicorn
question number 1 where do you live  
 bridalwood  i knew
are unicorns in trees  
do they eat pizza   so what do you put on top  
or why not  
can you really crush pony brains with your horns out  
can this be passed  
can't but you can do this
tada
wait don't you have magic  
sunny stascout
ah it hurts
sunny stascout i know the unicorn is with you
put your hands up and surrender
you are completely surrounded
will i be allowed to do my job  
 you will be arrested  it's confusing
 can you sneak in    on average
that's enough then ok i will send them elsewhere
ok calm down
 i'll call them  no no
hi friend
i know what you're thinking
ah he already read our minds
hurry before they destroy our brains
what do you do   where are you going  
 bring more equipment  do we have them  
huh  
come on
 don't you have any magic    not
no magic  
if you mind we used to have
but that was a long long time ago
it's gone now
everypony thinks the pegasis did it
but hey
you just look confused are you ok
haha i'm running away with a nonmagical unicorn
what do we do now  
what are you doing
 you don't smell  thank you what
i've been taught that earth ponies smell like junk but they don't
hmm
what else do unicorns say about earth ponies  
two you guys are lazy and three brainless ponies
 beautiful  not only those three
what's the plan now  
wait i understand
izzy we're going on a mission
to mount cyper
 to pegasaila's village    yes we have to find out
what happened to your magic and how to get it back
they have magic they can help us
but pegasi is not good
what if you guys are wrong about that  
earth ponies and unicorns were mistaken
if they accept us with open arms
but what if it doesn't  
 above is the sky turning black   
 that brings us to a big question 
 i'm afraid i'll end up being a lost pony in pegasi 
 but you're not alone 
 you have a pony with you 
 are there   who 
 i'll take care of you 
 when you get off the road 
 i'll take care of you 
 trust me 
 i'll take care of you 
 at home first earth ponies 
 i've heard it enough times that i can 
 i fought for change but alone 
 because there are no two 
 if you need a friendly hand you know exactly 
 i think i know 
 i'll take care of you 
 when you go the wrong way 
 i'll take care of you 
 trust me 
 i'll take care of you 
 in mountains like these 
 i have abilities 
 pony let's go now 
  let's go    let's go 
 i'll take care 
 i'll take care of you 
 i'll go wherever you go 
 that's the only thing i want to do 
 i'll take care 
 you 
i told him no more help no more rescue
he didn't give me a chance there is nothing to do
ok let's arrest him
then let's bring him to justice
a problem when you said we did you mean  
you and me
ah i'd love to come
but i have to clear the table
stirring my leaves
do you know i think you are right
this is hitch's work and only hitch's
okay sprout you stay here while i'm with the questions
calm all the ponies because peace is strength

 they have a small brain  what do you do for that  
 did you bring the shield    what shield  
 didn't you read the safety book    yes
 okay not  ah right
i will take care of this
 this is creative  what's it like to fly  
is your arm span the same as your height

but what if the unicorns come back  
really if you're all right  
unicorns can come back
they can even bring pegasi
we are all in trouble
this is not the time to be complacent
we have to do something
 something is hiding something is here 
 feeling something strange 
 increased discord and introduced fear 
 therahi whispers 
 terrible terrible 
 people outside get up early 
 the branches are being cut and the beechal is being prepared 
 think what they can do 
 oh 
 they will steal and snatch and kidnap 
 they will conquer the city 
 don't just sit and wait 
 we have to do something now 
 it's good to be nervous it's good to be stressed 
 don't let them get you 
 you don't need a reason 
 this is not the time to think too much 
  general    general

this is the scent of the princess
now you can too
la pip perfume
something is wrong
we didn't see any ponies flying
except the royal family
spray   are you listening
this is not like a cave
 ahhh  hey
i'm sorry to put you two on here but i need to talk
the princess  
your highness
zip tell me zip
ok sip i am sunny
this is my friend
izzy moon bow
sunny izzy i have something important to ask you
 about magic  that's why we came here
maybe you can tell us details about it  
izzy doesn't know how the unicorns lost their magic so we thought
wow wow wait
lost   does that mean no magic  
that changes things
listen i have some information that might be important
but first you tell me about this
my diary thanks zip
i never thought i'd see this again
i can do a lot of things secretly when i want to
awesome
i'm not that good
so where did it come from  
this is my father's why  
that star
zip what are you doing here   mother said to stay away
 okay so why are you here    find things
princess  
why don't ponies fly  
everyone knows that only royalty can fly
what
i know it's unfair but that's how it is
if there is any way teach the people to fly too
we like to come in one feather
ok zip  
yes with one feather
ah a dress rehearsal have to go
same goes for you
i have something to show you
are you coming or not  
garbage
 i mean a clue  ah
a unicorn hair
pegasi
footprints fade
sunny sunny sunny sunny
did you think you escaped  
think again
i don't eat i don't sleep
maybe a little sleep and a break
if you are not found in the next few hours
but after that nothing can stop me
thank you you are kind
 more  shhh
i will come wherever you go
even if there were deserts cold lightnings
no road is dangerous no trace is small
the past doesn't matter this is fair
what   what  
caught
look at the foot
ah
 where are we    isn't this great  
i'm pretty sure this is one way
a place made for earth ponies and unicorns to stay
like a place that every pony had forgotten
this is evidence all the ponies were like friends
my father is right
it's pretty weird being the only pegasus that can fly
the truth is we can't fly either
we are lying
a lie   but how  
you can't imagine what a few cords and a good light can do
but i have this crazy life now
that's why i come here
stay away from all that
more do this
 wow  wow
his light shines brightly
but that's not why i brought you here
this is what i wanted to show you
my stars
this was made a long long time ago
when we had magic
this is beautiful
 what is this    this is the pegasi crystal
this is part of my mother's crown
hmm and the unicorn crystal  
see
don't they fit  
these two crystals must be together
unity
what are you saying
maybe you lost your magic because the crystals were separated
if we add them
will the magic return  
all three pony races will reunite
 ok  come on
but where is the unicorn crystal  
if you are looking for crystals
we have millions in bridlewood
so we are going there now originally a pegasi crystal
gotta get it from your mom
it is not an easy task
he never takes off the crown
 the queen stays clean 
what do we do now  
ok pip is performing at the royal festival today
everyone is looking at it especially my mom
his mind is elsewhere
all we have to do is exchange the real crown for a false one
i can make a fake one
but i want the box of macaroni
gum bottle 14 teddy bears
three jellybeans
more glitter powder
i will bring them
i'll give them to sunny he will bring them to you
after making the fake crown come to the palace
everyone will come and sit there
so security is tight
i'll redirect them so you can infiltrate
stealth as much as possible
you must not move go carefully
to the main hall but beware of the guards
 ah  oh
i'll open the door the one behind the stage
when pip's singing begins my mother is in awe
then you can easily change the crown
it's so easy
definitely
i know you met our guests
did pip say that  
you know he says everything
if you tell me more
you will be queen one day put on this crown
trust me it's heavier than it looks
actually i have something to tell you
unicorns don't have magic powers either
i don't think we can fly though
zepirina i don't know what stupid
thoughts on whether you put a unicorn on your head
but it is our duty to take care of our people
pegasis is so happy that we can fly
why would you want to interfere with that  
because it's a lie
they are careful
one day you will understand
your sister knows
 ah here he is   iii 
 show season 
we begin
remember to smile
ah
 we have the light we are strong 
 we are together 
 if you want everything is in the mind 
 we have the light why wait any longer 
 we are all together 
 if you want you can even paint the sky 
 don't think what they say send it to me 
 but found a new way 
do not you stay
do not
ah
 we don't fly like before we take care of what we have 
 we will feel like new 
ah
sunny satarscout you hand…
oh
 i shine more 
 babbling with love 
 jump up and slide 
 babbling with love 
 jump up slide 
 babbling with love 
 we're on top what do you say   
 everywhere i've been i'm different 
 but my skin is so good 
 if you don't think it's right 
 break it down 
 don't stop till the sun rises 
 we don't fly like we used to 
 let's take comfort in what we have 
 we feel brand new 
these prisoners
 shh  don't make noise
 i babble more 
 we get light and get stronger 
 we are together 
no problem do not be afraid
i won't blow your brains out right  
ah
what  
ah
 go upstairs and find the gloves 
 fly around 
 do what i love 
 why are you like that what am i like 
what is going on
 dry off and eat some mud 
 babble with love 
ah
 i got it  ok
let's go
stop
these prisoners
another earth pony
 he is a liar  a lie
can't royals fly too  
 lies  zip  
zip soon
can't they fly too  
he is lying
he is a liar
soon on this side
ok i think we missed them
hitch what are you doing here  
you will be arrested save
you know doing both now
happy
thank you but we have nothing to save right  
and you  
his mother is the queen
just wait does that mean you are a princess  
look at that the sheriff is now a detective
what
a special news mount cyper today
shocked to know that even royals can't fly
pip is my favorite
if we can't trust our royals who will  
i blame unicorns and earth ponies
they lost everything
just received news queen heaven was arrested for lying
a great deception
don't say anything no pictures
ok one picture
anyone explain  
we needed the crystal
see
come on no no no no
 it's not in this  really  
on the bright side we had a lot of fun getting rid of it
gotta get it back
but it can be anywhere
someone explain why this is so important
as much as ruining my show
believe me that's how it is
while you hung me there left
now everyone knows we can't fly
a warrant is issued for the princess's arrest
pip zip save yourselves
what this can't happen
 this is impossible  pip
forget them we think we can get the magic back
but we need crystals
are you crazy
oh this might be your last chance
ok
i know a way to go
come on
what wait you can't
but i'm the sheriff
hey
why is it not over yet  
we made it as fast as we could but we ran out of nails
a nail story
make this work right  
honey i know your secret project
it is very important
but when are you my servants  
sent back to make catalog items  
get back to work
this is my factory
this is my hometown mom
now your son an emperor of the maritime bay
an emperor  
but yesterday you were a sheriff weren't you  
did you see how quickly i upgrade  
this defense factory has started work
it's because of your love and encouragement
the break is over
oh dear
this pony's head is swollen
this is the tree on the map
that means on this side
what am i doing here
walking in the big blue grass
looking for a magic crystal that you don't even know exists
it could have been my best performance
now it's over
i am a criminal
 it's all because of them  they are
it's the last round
no not like that
i agreed with a pegasi didn't i  
hey are you sure he knows where the crystals are  
don't you believe me
i don't know
it's because of you that mom is in jail now
once we get the magic back the whole kingdom will be amazed
things that happened here before will be forgotten
you'll be a hero pip
let's settle one thing
we are near the river
after this escape was over
you're going back home with me to maritime bay
 did you understand that    obviously
great because the meaning of this badge is me
ah
come on where's my badge hey
 you  hmm  
i know unicorns love shiny things
you know i saw your shiny badge on the floor
 a few hours ago  what   hours  
maybe it's good just between us
something unhealthy is coming out of that badge
what do we do now  
got an idea zip  
know what's best right now   wait think
maybe if you could fly  
know something better  
getting lost in an unimaginable place
ok now this is over time to go home
i wish i could say it's nice to meet you all but it's not
 come on sunny  i don't think so
everyone stop
anyway we went to the other side and found the crystal
we need to bring back the magic
once we do that you can fly
you will get your arms back and you will be able to arrest me
is everyone happy now  
tada
 okay  great
come on ponies
yay awesome
oh stupid stick
need help sheriff  
do not thank you i can
oh i wish i had a match
ah
 it's sad to wait  come on don't be a hero
come and warm up
are you sure about this  
because if we go back to maritime bay
what do we have to lose  
taking magic to our enemies   wait think
 i know a lot  come on
do they look like enemies to you  
is my urine like water  
it's my favorite color for sixth grade
i do not know
maybe i should go back to maritime bay
if that's what you want
but you know i'm so glad you're here
all of us
i think we will go tomorrow morning
last stop bridalwood
what's wrong isi
it is to be with you
the best thing that ever happened in my life
i don't want this adventure to end
but izzy you get magic
may i ask you a question  
why did you come to maritime bay  
i always wanted to come when i was little
i found this beautiful lantern it had a message
it said i have friends in maritime bay
isn't that you
i made this with my dad
we always promised
someday we can prove it
that all ponies are friends
let's do our part
hey
i want to do my part too
what's to lose right  
 woohoo  okay
i must say the unicorn forest is like a magic world
not so
come on not far from my house
here there is
isi villa
wow
 did you make these    yes
recycling funny right  
 this is awesome 
 i also made friendship bracelets  great
wait watch this catch everything
i could never do this with real friends
 tada  ah
i wish i could show this live
we don't have time for that now
to get the information we need
as for the unicorn crystal we're not just sitting around
we must be like unicorns
yay makeup i love it so much
no this is not what i came for
issy can you do this  
an appearance  
honey you've come to the right place
 i thought earth ponies were the bottom of the rung 
 i've heard that pegasi are evil hate them 
 you smell fishy and you're weird 
 you might eat chicks too 
 whoever you meet you have to run 
 but i know we're all a different breed 
 having removed our branches and horns we are very afraid 
 we put aside our differences because we want to win 
 ohoh 
 let's tear the pages out of our history books 
 we disguise ourselves and say we are not thugs 
 look at your new look as we walk through the crowd 
 you guys are a perfect match 
this is the new law
 you fit perfectly 
this is not working
 they taught us that unicorns are crazy 
 it has razor sharp edges and teeth that can chew 
 they cut your hands and squeeze them as a night drink 
 the bottom line is that unicorns aren't like that 
 i know we're risking everything to do this 
 but look at us we're brave strong weird smart 
 we have nothing to do and can't wait to start 
 you guys fit in here 
if you say so
 you guys fit in here 
i know it now watch and learn
 this is how unicorns walk 
 take a walk 
 this is how unicorns talk 
 talk 
 this is how unicorns throw balls 
 drop the ball 
  here are the unicorns   oops
stop
 proud unicorns are like this 
 look at our unicorn dancing back 
 now you guys are a unicorn    wow 
 soon you are unicorn geniuses 
 you're blaring with a unicorn horn 
 it's more of a head that's where your pride is on your forehead 
 every unicorn wears a unique horn 
 so let's attack them and you'll be surprised 
 we will win with those stones in our pockets 
 when we play a new tune the crowd dances on stage 
 our magic will be back 
 by now equestria's heart is gone 
 but let's do our part to help find it 
 if we fail we'll be put in jail 
 but if not let's scream 
 let's start now 
 we fit in here 
 this is how a unicorn walks 
 this is how a unicorn walks 
 now you see a strong unicorn 
 this is how the unicorns end the song 
tada crystals
crystals crystals
crystals
does he know that we are looking for something else  
crystals
crystals crystals
come on
come on
 hey  hey
this is exciting
you are very different from other unicorns
yes everyone says that
bridlewood can't stand my glitter

ugh
 you said a bad word  huh  
hurry before the evil comes
ah
 binbonbin binbon binbon 
 binbon binbon 
ok
can you explain me a bit  
unicorns have a lot of blind faith
if a pony says a forbidden word
we have to make a sacrifice to get rid of it
 dirty    misfortune
banned words  
magic branches feathers
more mayonnaise
 what's wrong myo  ah dadadada
come on
i have something to show you
a crystal tea room  
in this one there is a pony who collects crystals
he will help us
that's awesome izzy
 ah hitch  i know i know
no forbidden words
earth ponies are evil more smell
pegasi screams
that's the pony i said
everyone in the forest says you collect crystals
yes
i mean it did
i lost all of them competing with alphabet

i challenge you to that
do you think you can win  
there is only one way to know
big talk for a little pony
i think you will know that i am of average height
ticktock what do you mean  
what you bet must be something special
will this be special  
ah what are you doing  
don't worry i can solve that puzzle in my dreams
but if he wins we lose both crystals
 it won't happen believe me  izzy
if your friend is running out of time shall we begin  
ok
now give me that
no no no
there is a special competition for special gifts
bring on the ultimate challenge
what is the highest now  
a dancing competition really  
both ponies agree two thirds
let's make this more interesting
you only have to win one third
ok that's how it works
hey
it doesn't matter you just trained

i'll make this quick
pay attention
ok
children get ready for my crystals to appear
the third round who will win

 explain  there he is
queen of crime
you are coming with us now
ah unicorn
returning my crystals and leaving bridlewood

haha doubt about that
unicorns cheat anyway
pegasis always thought they were smarter than us
hey that's our queen
she is not a queen here
 who do you think you are    we will ask you
 this is our land  you are not invited here
surrender with the crystals or i will use my power
i'd love to see it done
no ponies have magic powers
binbon
but we came to take it back
can it be done  
 did he say magic    that's a lie
i know this is hard to believe
but let us try
oh mother believe me
you two
ok
you're wasting time kid
issy ready

why isn't this working dad  
because this is a false belief
let's do it again

you did everything you could
i thought this would be fine
i had a lot of faith in it
what do we do now sunny

that's even better
but we can bring it back

don't we want to fight then  
that's a relief

sannasak a very old one
made to make the occasion beautiful
 your sweet miss  what are mine  
i don't want to bother you

they could not be removed
more than five minutes
 sorry  hmm
 no i want this  tie
no device will help you in this
to come out of the house on each other's intelligence
keep hope
 hmm  tyler
ok
that's right
 thank you  umma
some time ago
the epidemic was caused by strange events
all over this city
the people who lived here began to see things
impossible things
things that should be locked up
in dreams and nightmares
the church condemned black magic
as the work of the devil
the fear of the doctors spread in one way
making heart disease
but later discovered the reason for these events
that is between these walls
here lived a creator an ascetic
came to the theory test
theories rejected by the outside world
the city sent five men
stop testing this manufacturer
there was no news about them again
find out what happened to your responsibility
for the missing people
help them escape from the house
each room has a hidden key
help to move forward
you have only one hour to complete this task
then you will be obsessed with the powers that lurk here
if somewhere you can't stay anymore
say the word wake up
then you will be thrown out of the house
but i warn you
that you are not ready for everything
this is going to happen at home
ok that's a little weird
this isn't really scary is it  
not this will be fun
this is locked
what do we do now  
we play
let's stop standing still and look for clues
ok
what will the clue look like  
it could be anything it's irrelevant here
everything here is irrelevant
ayavask  
near ayahuasca
that is tea the devils drank them
talking to the other world
a south american thing
 i walk a lot  hmm
south america  
 yes  just like those masks
 like a mask  isn't this great  
i think yes
what do you think what did this creator come up with  
must be creative
got something   a clue  
you think now you are inside this
next 60 minutes calm down  
 it's okay if your email is late  okay
there is nothing here did you find anything there  
yes my favorite band
 uh  hmmmm
i have their best songs
 really    not
they don't have the best songs
no no don't put it back let's see how the songs are
 there is some clue in this  okay
here
put it here
ok i'm very sorry this is the last
yes that's right wait wait wait
 what    listen
not he's right
he sings about a dog and a bird
yes so  
look at this mask
ok these are not in order
naya should stay
now the bird
wolf pig
see
that's the hand
awesome honey karen
the fun isn't over yet
now we need to find the password
 really    tyler
uh um
we are now looking for some numbers
ok it must be in something we don't count
these are all the same color i do not know
wow it's fierce
 melanie  tyler
 are you hurt    no no i am fine
 didn't anyone else see it    what  
awesome ty not going out
not i'm not going out
i think i drank too much tea
you are right
these places are created
like jumping at your own shadow
i am not worried
put each idea in your head
 probably because of that movie  hmmmmm thank you
 hmm  baby
don't do to this one what was done to the haunted house last time
 is it    no no no
you stepped on a jar of jelly
screamed and went out in ten minutes
you know i'm into these things
i don't like it
right   but i'm here right  
see am i there
i'm here we're looking for clues
let's find some clue right

another room
i thought it was just one room but there are many here
tyler
ok we are doing well
there are still fifty minutes
but we haven't found anyone yet

dad look at this
this is great
how to do this

# from overthemoon(2020)sinhalasubtitlesrt
scientists talk a lot about space
they can tell the distance to the stars
they can say space starts 100 km from earth
but they can't tell about space dogs
he likes to chase comets dance in the stardust
as the space dog thinks the moon is a big ball
every night he eats a piece
that is the real reason the moon is slowly waxing
then when the moon is big and round
does that mean the space dog didn't eat  
at that time the moon god called chanye the dog and took out the moon
ok now shall i do the scientific explanation  
sorry dad i like mom's explanation
lost
 tell me about chanye  again  
again and again i would love to hear about the moon goddess
tell me mom
 a long time ago a story from the past 
 beautiful kind chanye 
 a handsome man named huey fell in love 
is it true love  
 true love 
 but she drank a magic potion 
 be immortal 
 then he floated away leaving love 
 now he waits alone in the moon 
now he lives there
alone with jade the rabbit in the moon
why  
because huey died on earth
now when he cries those tears turn into moonshine
 waiting waiting for his true love 
 waiting for him the moon 
 forever   
 forever

you are very thin does no one feed  
everyone knows the hairy guy because of his weirdness
fay fay maybe we can use my dates second bit
mom likes to add watermelon seeds
ah our family has been growing in the garden
eat and see very tasty
i think i'm allergic to them
also we make this in our own special way
ok
your right or my right  
it seems that the weight of the table increases every year
the heat is maddened looking forward
rabbits can't stay at the table i remember what my mother used to say
and this is my chair
the table is very beautiful where do i sit
here near me
thank you
ok
the hairy leg comes to our water breaking the fishing nets
look how big the moon is
you have a little sauce on your face
it will be very big for the moon festival
mom's favorite festival
your father said you are a fan of chanye
oh poor woman that goddess is alone in the moon above
no one else there is only the jade rabbit
come on chanye would like to be left alone
that's why he drank both immortality pills without saving huey
actually as my mother said i am also a descendant of huey
hooey archer
chin
that didn't happen aunty hui was fighting demons
his bow and arrow
 then a thief came and tried to steal the immortal pills  
yes yes yes he thought to hide them and put them in his mouth
is it possible  
chanye floated up into the air leaving his lover alone on the ground
disappeared like dust
now she lives without a husband and with a rabbit
a good choice
but it is not his choice he didn't want to leave huey
he misses huey crying everyday
how do you know that  
messaged
 don't make fun of fae fae  it's a false illusion
it is not an illusion that's true chanye is true
ah fay fay
he is now in the moon waiting for his true love
are you waiting father  
ah
let him stay a while
he is the first in the class but still trust chanye  
bunji you and me are the only ones left in the end

ok let's see
get used to him   it will never happen
what is special about your mooncake  
i don't care i don't even care about you
i want everything to be like it was before
he trusted chanye before he said that chanye is true
but now everything has changed
if the father believes again he will not marry that woman
he will remember everything he will remember you too

 your kind eyes from the moon

 that you will be forgotten 
 from every story you told me

 he lost his most precious huey 
 then floated into the sky 
 she wanted him forever 
 so dad why can't he   
 show this story to be true if i can

this is a strange experience
do you feel that we are close   because that's how i am
i feel this is great always friends
 forever eternal 
 chica chica chica chica 
huh  
good time
why do you live alone  
it's a personal matter
but now that we are like family i will say
it happened a long time ago
the queen kicked me out of mali because i sang her a song
he was fired because of a song  
he is not like what his mother said
mom said he was kind gentle
calm as a swan
before huey died he was like that
then he pushed us away
after losing the person you love the most
you are changing
yes
after i sang the song the queen got angry
all the light in the moon disappeared
we called it the great darkness
can you sing that song  
i don't know
when you sing from a frog it doesn't sound right
please
ok
 have you ever had dandruff   
huh  
 have the sand dunes caused snow   
did you ask that  
 a dance of color and brightness 
what are you doing  
 i know 
 right here in front of your eyes 
 a bright polymorphic indicator 
gobi
 never the same 
 it's so beautiful 
 have you looked at the earth   
 how to spin around and float 
i don't spin
 white and blue clouds 
not
 i know 
 they change all the time spinning and throwing away 
 it's just spinning 
 it's so beautiful 
i want everything to be the way it was
 look at the world around you 
 every chance 
 every moment we have 
 in case of something new 
 yes 
 shine 
 shine 
 are you scared 
 shrink when it hurts 
 hold on to the memories 
 me too 
 if you let go of the past 
 you'll go ahead and eventually bloom 
 my heart is full 
 know that 
 you can shine 
 you are awesome 
and that's what you told the queen  
not another song
 gobi  okay that's it
[singing in mandarin]
 always and forever 
 this is in my heart 
jade  
what happened to you
it went well you did it
it was made on time
now all i want is the present
ah
why did i trust those chickens  
there they are
there's my doll
don't worry i'll take it
hey little friend
where is it
ah
are you mad   it's mine
giving back
don't put your stupid hands on this
do not
now there is no gift left
fay fay   come out now they went
come out fay fay i will do what you say
what do i need to do  
look up
i have lost everything now

you still have this this
and this
and you live that's a big thing
that gift was the only way i had to stop my father from remarrying
getting married again  
your mother i mean no  
now i'm stuck with this no gifts now
my father married that strange woman and crazy boy
what a crazy kid
an incredibly troublesome boy
no one likes troublemakers they are a nuisance
they always make faces
he always jumps frogs
he thinks he can be on the other side of the roof like a bat and goes through the walls
 he always interrupts  say this
does he jump frog  
did that make you think we should go over the frogs  
not really
he is like a bat on the other side that's how you survived without dying right  
did you get these ideas from him  
not
anyway i don't like him
i don't want him either
 did you say he can go through walls    forget it
i like a brother
but then i was alone for thousands of years
how long have you been alone  
four
after a while your opinion will change
i think this bandya is hungry
hey we don't eat anything  
everything looks good when the stomach is full
there is a taste map
yummy eat a map
yesterday
i can't imagine you eating mooncakes
these mooncakes have no life
come on
what is this apparently a piece of something
chin must have found this somewhere
after that the mooncake must have been put inside as a joke
i said he was a troublemaker
just wait why do i see it  
not never seen
this half is completed with those symbols
this is a piece of music this is the gift
there is still time
i will give this to chanye
come on
let's help fay fay
no barriers
ah

 brighter than the stars 
[song in mandarin]

you don't belong here
but i belong here
you can't stay here
like me you will be stuck alone forever
forget you
but how  
 i know you feel sad 
 i can see it in your eyes 
 the pain is too much 
 when someone you love dies 
 but there is a time to forget 
 take away the pain in your heart 
 it has a future for you just for you 
 love if you can 
 give love if you can and your family will meet 
 it may not be what it used to be 
 but if you give love love will never be lost 
 it's just getting bigger 
 very much 
 no need to build rockets 
 you can be strong now 
 from the things you searched for 
 come here till now 
 even if you feel sad without him 
 his spirit is always near 
 so believe that he is always near you 
 love someone new now 
no barriers
give me my sister
chin
am i still a stupid chick  
yes you are my stupid baby
shall we go home now  
ok
wait
what are you doing
i think it's too late now huey is not coming back
 gifts are not the answer 
 you are not alone 
 love is all around you 
 there's always a love you know 
 although i feel sad without him 
 his soul is always near you 
 the heart grows 
 know that 
 you can shine 
 you are awesome

he doesn't understand what i'm saying do you understand

 and to an animal  thank you
you did well peter
he was sorry for the mistake and finally repented a little to ask for forgiveness
sorry what
i hear these when i feel misunderstood

then i wear these when people come to scold me
you are always a step away from what you want
sorry what
what is this  
basiljones publishers
we sold half of their books at harrods

my tomatoes
i never thought that a man would like to grow so much
i have also heard that he wants to sell them in the market
it's getting hotter i will bring the hair dryer
doing it at the same time is a hobby for him
i hope he will be as successful in his hobby as i am
what is that  
accepting that decisions will be made
what happened to his hair  
wait you don't have to bother eating me anymore
remember   you have permission for all these things
ok ok ok still getting used to it
i get a lot of energy
i think it may be because these new plants and fruits are not chasing you anymore
i'm like this
have you tried jogging  
what is jogging  
running to a scared animal when it is not in front of you
 do you think it will work    i don't have much hope either
here baby
i can't believe this will change anything
i'll take it
it could be the publisher
peter you know don't touch these things
honestly my kids are better behaved
hello  
i miss you dad
no one understands me like you do
b b that's the publisher
hello

 hello  b
you are more beautiful than i thought
 thomas  hello
 handsome guy  well
i'm sure i'll be asking you to publish your next book…
 one of those who knocked on the door  yes by many
actually we don't have a door anymore as soon as i knocked on it the hinges fell off
here are the stars the leader of the herd with peter
always at the forefront
dead
i am not your leader i don't always take the lead
look you come here benjamin turn around
mopsy step back to your right flopsy you come this way
benjamin mopsy split aside there you go you stay here
i'll be here
if you'll indulge me the book is really great
a great achievement
i'll let you
what greater gift than the love of a rabbit
 by charles dickens  yes
okay he said a cat you obviously knew that
for sure i love dickens
 he knows every word he wrote  know  
 no you don't know  i know
i don't think so
strengthen
 yes  do you box  
yes no i yes i do i am boxing
 are you hitting too    yes
 no you can't  yes i do
 when    i weave big ropes
i lift heavy bars i have sandbags
i take off my shirt and do pushups
i also love protein shakes
 okay let's get down to the ring sometime  yes that's no problem
 now i would like to show you our strategies  sorry
carlos give our rabbits some water
b sit here
foaming water and still water
shocked
like drinking sand
i like it they are delicious
 you say that to change  not like that
then drink more
that is death
so we need to start printing 5000 copies of your book
 fifty    i think you want to write the second book  
i didn't really think about it but
i don't know thought i had a short template
write a book series of 23 books with 109 characters based on the joys of my life
create an interwoven story about morality nature and family
landscaping around our farm
great
great great
because we can see that it is a great resource for your next book
 great  great
 great  great
i don't trust this joke
we did a little research on your book
now people like the story and the background
but they love rabbits
so in the second book we want to emphasize their individuality
benjamin the wise
pulun natta kentikaraya
this person is good
flopsy mopsy double fast
 why do we always get treated like that    like one person  
 but we both  look at lasasana
 and finally peter  what  
do you have me   this is crazy
we have two alternate characters for him
i have two  
the mischiefmaker or
initiator of evil
not he did so well
that that's it that's right
 what    that's our favorite too
 really speaks to his character  no it's not like that
don't you think it's cruel to be called the originator of evil  
well he's a bit of a mischievous one really
even according to your own book
he tried to separate you two and destroy his own family
he's a little mischievous but that's not to say
 absolutely right thank you  i caught him yesterday
while trying to steal my tomatoes
no no no what i really wanted to do was don't let anyone steal your tomatoes
 i also think that his voice will be annoying  what  
my voice doesn't bother me right  
i have something to show you
see how much we like to do this here
oh my god
my ears are very big
peter looks like a real villain
 every story needs a villain  i am not a villain
it will not reveal the true status of any of us
it's like i'm looking in a mirror
 i like it  what  
i think that's wonderful
it is unbelievable
your family is so precious to be up there
that was my dream come true
they look so beautiful
come on
♪ i walk alone i walk alone ♪
the song you were told of course
i can sing another song if you like
your wish
♪ at one point i thought ♪
♪ someone on the street will meet me ♪
until then i will walk alone
what are you looking at son  
have you ever seen anyone steal before  
do you seem like a very nice person  
i'm not a very good person
apparently i'm bad
yes something went wrong
anyway i thought kids were supposed to be like that  
learning growing evolving
but i guess this rabbit doesn't get it
do you know   i don't care now
you are fine son
but if i may suggest something
next time you meet an old thief on the street
then don't say your things so much
 sorry  no i like it
not everyone here has evolved like me
the name is barnabas nice to meet you
 peter  take a peach
you said you weren't very nice
not i'm not a very good person
i am the worst
oh shit
 come on  this is a nest of mice
 i don't like it when they call us rats  come back here
and when they tried to hit us with a broom
 that's not what the broom is for  get out of my shop
i'm sick of these rats
you owe me a peach son
fortunately these guards were near the house
 where did you come from    you don't care uncle
what
i told you not to say your things
now you are learning but i am also curious to know the truth
i am in the village on a farm by a pond
really   where did you get that jacket  
an old friend of mine had something like that
this is my father's
we want to go
are you ok son
yes i'm fine
did you wink at me
sorry
no no i knew who the only rabbit could wink at
my friend in the village lived near a pond
wait a little that farmer's name isn't mcgregor is it  
 yes  are you peter rabbit  
 yes  i can't believe it
my old friend i think it must be your father
they are in the trash
 what are we doing    let's have some fun
there you are
how can this be fun  
because they really believe they have a chance
ok
should this be paper or plastic  
nobody really knows
caught
what do we do now  
 you are right it's great fun  yes
they are still around every corner
caught
now going
that's going in havo
who are these people   where are they taking us  
calm down son
i won't let anything happen to you
here
here
here
a fingerprint there
i want to say something
my book is very personal to me and i don't want to get into trouble
if this is clearly being used for commercial gain i can't even die in freedom
probably in the hands of an american
i give you my word that i will be your guardian
that you become a fortress between your art and those willing to take advantage of it
let's do it
i mean this guy is useless
of course it is very contemporary
the number of readers will increase and your land fund will benefit
shall we put hawon's pictures on shoes and tshirts  
but you are an optimist
i respect that
sir marvin stewart is out waiting for you
marvin
one of our authors
marvin stewart
hi marvin i'll be down soon
when his book reached number one we also bought him that car
marvin made a picture book about butterflies
very beautiful and charming
they can be hung in a museum 250 copies sold
i made a small suggestion
15 million copies sold
it sold better than deacon's
 where is peter    yes i think there is trouble
he doesn't like this
the last time i saw him he was looking at the billboard
notice board
but really where is peter  
this time two people are caught it's dead
i don't know why i came here
i want him
he is just like peter in the book my grandmother gave me
they want to go together can i have this one too mom please  
like father and son
not much before and after
they are very dirty
ok then let's
honestly i don't know why you like these things they are pests
liam we brought two rabbits
the next one might get a little thrown up but it's really a lot of fun
do not touch them until they are vaccinated
they can have epidemics
my person's name is monkey face
mine is cottage cheese
aren't you a good rabbit  
hello hello hello
this is so dumb
here try this
very good thank you
let's go kids let's go to grandma's house
aren't they afraid of the dark mother  
they are animals they don't feel that way
is this what you mean by being like a pet  
the children think they are good but the mother is really evil
what do we do now  
let's get down to business
the greatest gift
get a bag son they are always under the sink
i will open from the front door
fidget with tomatoes
they call us animals too
i understood that
you wanted to get caught
you wanted to go to the pet store
you should be adopted so you can buy their food
this was mcgregor's garden in nagare
this is how we live
really   are these all like you  
not there are usually boiled kamas in pots
they have saved a bottle of champagne for a special occasion where no one else is coming
oh that's so sad
yes that is really sad
anyway let's steal some more stuff shall we  
wait are we stealing from kids too  
only things they never eat
why do parents put lunch boxes in them  
then you don't need to scold the teachers
lots of stuff son
how do we get them out of here  
without a good team to pull things it is useless to get down to important work
get to know the team samuel whiskers the oldest thief in town
that beard is not his
they were stolen
tom kitten
he doesn't read much but when he works it's better not to read too much
can we come in now   my little girl is getting cold
his sister mittens a brain
we are always on the right track
enough introductions let's get down to business
 storage room    go to the right and the second door
 the court room    go left and take the third door
 the bathroom    i told you to leave before you come
 in the corner of the hall  thank you
so where do we get these things out of here  
will this really work  
a well dressed man can get away with doing anything in this world
and if she has a baby she can go anywhere
three weeks ago
we rang the stock market starting bell
why did you want to do that  
because we can do that
ok
howard where have you been  
i need you to help me get rid of those nasty rabbits
before the kids come home

and we have peter to thank for that
he is the boy the boy who is the boy he is the boy

 he doesn't say anything does he    no no i won't say anything
i said i still feel confused when i remember what i did to my mother
fridge door champagne hair dryer
 i think it's a bit cruel  are you a gang member or not  
yes i would like to be but i don't do these things
 can't we talk it out and settle it    oh oh
no no please
we're just kidding
we are all playing a game with you i want to see your face son
no i'm kidding you too so
you have to think about it
is there a private place you can go to  
when you wet your own place
we share with our friends
besides we won't be able to eat it all before it goes bad
pigs can fly
come on let's go for a walk
oh there were special times
food for all wellspaced places
before old macgregor came and battered the walls
we all thought it was our last but except your father
now the question is:
did he steal or did he take what was his  
exactly right we were there first
 it belonged to  he stole
but he filled your stomach in the only way he could
he taught me everything he knew
shall we eat a delicious meal  
stay right here
coming to you
eat here son
wow delicious what are these
that's an artapar fruit
whatwhat  
may i ask you a question   is my voice annoying  
yes it's a little overgrown but i like it together
i like this place no one says i'm bad
i really feel like i belong here
i wish there were 10 more like you
then i can do the work that your father and i dreamed of
 we can eat all the time  peter
peter

hey peter we looked for you everywhere
god's help are you ok

i went for a walk come on let's go

doing some pushups
oh you've got a sudden urge to exercise haven't you  
did you suddenly feel like reading dickens  
you know he is my favorite author
name another book by dickens
do another pushup
ok
oops i'm stuck i'm stuck
get up kids get up we have a duty to do
 what    dad
 come on  we are very tired
but we have to lift the huge fireball into the sky
only then will the earth heat up and we will be able to live like before
what
 really    that is a very big responsibility
now snort around freely and do nothing for the next 24 hours
are you ready to tell me where you went yesterday  
 you scared us all  don't be afraid brother
i met someone who can change my life
did you find a girl yes tell me everything
what is his name mary   scarlet   josephine  
— barnabas  wonderful
 no he is an old friend of your father's  dead
not he is a thief
peter you don't have my blessing to kiss a thief
will you let me tell my story without messing it up  
 let's run a race flopsy  i'm not flopsy anymore
i changed my name from yours because i wanted to be different
from now on i am the lavatory (toilet)
 lavatori    yes
i run with two legs now
that's great
imagine how much of this land we could conserve
our children will also be able to see the wonder of nature
 look sisters  wait for me
i never had the chance to do that
haven't played in the orphanage
that's why i imagine that there are twolegged children playing with me
yes if i paint aaron in the shoes they will have the whole mountain
if you hit them on tshirts and jeans they'll get the whole hammer
yes can you imagine  
 what happened to him    he changed his name to bathroom
go join them play
 really    yes
like stretched across my legs extended my arms folded inward
the one that slowly rolls safely down the hill  
 yes i can  maybe it won't work for you
let's go have a cup of tea
what do you mean it doesn't work for me   it will be fine for me
 no right    i am very sure of that
i can play you think i can't  
 i didn't say that  madam look at this
imagine me and our future children playing
right   look
hey do you see look i'm playing
a little faster a little more speed
help help
that is why adults should not do children's things
all my life i stole from this garden and people said i was wrong
being with barnabas now i know this is what i am meant to do
i want to be a watcher
that barnabas seems a bit cunning
no he is not cunning he understood me just like father
 not like him  don't worry
see he has been telling me this since the day he came here
it wasn't told to you we told everyone
i'm talking to you peter especially
don't worry
anyway we won't be here long now he heard what he said
as soon as they have a baby we're done
did you feel unloved when the babies were born  
now it's different they think i am disobedient
so i embraced it
look barnabas is doing a great job and we can help
then we can arrange our life without expecting their help
i don't know
come on girl we are going to gloucester
 okay why not    are you going to gloucester  
i'm running there tomorrow because of the cardio day
 chest and arms today  where hival hami continue
you can do this
my trainer

benjamin stuffed natta flopsy mopsy
 yes  yes
ok but now it's lavatori but the previous one was ok
we came here to help with that big job you mentioned
oh no no it is very dangerous
ok thanks for the time is there a taxi stand nearby  
no trust me
we used to steal from mcgregor's garden all the time
this is very different
if something happens to you i will never forgive myself
no we can do anything you want right  
if you want to go higher we are your team

he seems to be good at this too
is there anything this guy can't do  
this is a quick fix
thomas shall i speak to the glass man now  
you spend six hours doing that
b nigel basil  john is here
basil  mr john what a surprise
you are my star
 is this a good time    this is a good time
this is a bad time
a word from dickens
i couldn't wait to show this
oh my god
 it's unbelievable  beautiful
we got a lot of response early on
the love for your next book is already high
that's wonderful
i also have something to show you
you will be hard pressed to tell the difference
 you drew it  that's great
artistic authentic no difference
 where is this    that's our garden
 isn't the space a bit limited    they are there
i think now that you have changed
you need to expand this a bit make it more fun brilliantly
either put them on a beach and give them a surfboard
 little guitar dila  did you send the ukulele   (ukulele  a small four string guitar)
ok dead idea see  
you take my stupid suggestions and turn them into great ones a genius
they can't play the ukulele
they don't go to the beach isn't it b   i said they are rabbits
why can't they be rabbits on the beach   or on a boat  
 or an astronaut    a spaceship  
readers need a different path thomas
a word from dicken
now listen this is a big job
the biggest
even if it's the same kind of work we did
we will never have to worry about food again
but you have to take some risk
every once in a while every farmer in the valley gets together
 get out of here  they are angry and mean
they want to take food from their land and they don't want us to take it
sweet ginger crunchy carrots
ripe radishes
they take it all to the main place where the ngara is
there they guard them from dawn till dusk
that's where we need to break into
it must be really hard to get in
there is no gate or door in sight they smile and wave to come
 come in  everyone is welcome
 will they not hear us    not
there is a band that plays similar folk music
what if the children see us   are they not going to take us back to adopt  
in this place they are a little tickled to see
if you want an expensive gift that will never be used
they sell them like lavender scented bathroom bombs
10 pounds
what is this amazing place  
they call it the farmers' market
the place has been meticulously recreated in this map
okay so this is the fruit these are vegetables
the pinnacle shows the limit of the sun
according to tomorrow's weather i have recorded six weeks in a row
except last saturday it was overcast in a way i didn't expect
 beard nobody cares about that  ok ok now
i think you are not people who learn by watching
but we are not going after baboga
any fool can steal if he has the guts
what we want is even more valuable
in the midst of all this
just beyond the two shops with coconut water and wooden spoons
there are many valuable things
our target: dried fruits
dried fruit  
 why do you want it    as if coming to okkare
lasting longer they are oneeighth the size of a piece of fresh fruit
but the nutritional value is the same
they are easy to carry and cannot be found at once
try eating them
that is terrible
this is not a jelly bin
hey we don't do those things here got it kid   your head will go crazy
the problem is the dried fruit is in the middle of the market
all the farmers are surrounded
the worst thing about farmers is that they stay together and take care of each other
they are an evil army united by evil
but even if we take care of them
we have to get past the toughest of them all
dried fruit vendor
sarah nakamoto
no matter what happens he will never leave his place
but sara nakamoto also has a secret
his leg didn't really feel it
an example of what was called a mystery is the son of the cheesemonger
william pemberley across the road
he is the only one who can get her attention
so if we catch her her attention will be diverted
the dried fruits will be ours then
how do we get them out of there  
our old friend upstairs comes to the market every week
just before it closed
he always buys two sausages one for him and one for his dead wife
it is a true love story really
they met at a jazz dance hall when they were young
she is a hatwearing girl he is a trumpet player
 but the parents did not allow it  beard
beards be careful
why doesn't anyone understand the value of a good interlude  
you know what they say at your funeral  
great woman always on topic
anyway we haul the loot into taylor's car
he's driving us back here right  
it all seems complicated
that's why i said it would be okay if there were ten more people like you
 do you have friends at home    yes i have many friends
can they be trusted  
there are two people who are not good to bring into the house
it doesn't matter bring everyone
come on felix let's go
come on felix let's go
 girls go get a light  okay
okay everyone
i think these have reached the point where they can be sold at the farmers market
i want to know everyone's honest opinion right  
don't hold back i want to know the truth but
only if they are good
so it really resonates with me
but remember for me the job is unsafe
 you left them on the beach  i'm just making the world bigger
you have enlarged it to space
 nigel told me  i know what nigel wants is this  
is this what you want  
i feel like you're messing things up
jam
what did you say
their space helmet great
just put it on little head ears down
you can see what is happening to the face that's great
nigel basil jones
he is successful intelligent and popular
two eyes that can change everything
he asks me
don't worry
and i don't even have to say it there's no peter here
where is peter
again i'm talking to rabbits
waiting for an answer
not it is not the future ok
electric light
to our british friends
torch
it will never happen
if we do this we will be on posters all over town
why are you up there mrs tiggywinkle  
sweet
whowhowho
kokkokko
come on
i lost my voice
get up get up
we have to get the big fireball up
what
how does this happen  
my existence has been a sham for so long
my whole life is a lie
wait but this means we can fly
i can even fly
can't
 kokkokko  kokkokko
when a new day dawns on the abandoned farm
it was not only peter and his friends who went looking for new experiences
b was thinking about the opportunity he got
peter flopsy mopsy cottontail and benjamin the brotherinlaw
the house was rebuilt with the help of others
and they lived happily ever after
you are a genius
come with me i have something to show you
i can't believe you're giving me this
i haven't even written the best story yet
this is how confident i am about the changes you make to the book
have you seen marvin lately  
 is that good    criticism goes both ways
but it has been number one in 23 countries
including germany they don't like butterflies
they have strange ideas i would like to introduce you to the company
marketing marketing strategy movies
we do not think of this book as a book
we think this is an opportunity we think you are a great opportunity
an opportunity ok
but at that time she has a husband and she is going to continue
think you're on the wrong path
so he went to meet the book publisher
do what he thinks is right for his wife
nigel
 but without telling him  thomas  
what a surprise twice in one day
i know what you're trying to do
it is very clear to me that you are trying to put what is on your mind into my wife's head
 tell me that to your face  i'm going to the gym do you box
yes i said boxing right  
 come with me  but the problem is
i couldn't bring my gloves
 don't think we'll give you one come on  really   ok
hey nigel
thanks for the gloves
my brotherinlaw happily gave these to you
listen i want to talk to you about b
you change his mind
i just want him to get some of my ideas
ok i can't stop feeling this way but he's losing his way
 not  not  
losing your way means no one will buy the books
because it's normal
the way you say it is wrong
you lose your way when you have children
about how the rabbit goes to the moon while the wife is busy drawing
to the moon really   does he do it  
ah nigel i'm very sorry
not i'm very sorry
but if you are so selfish
i don't know if you can be a father
why did you tell nigel i didn't want his opinion  
no no no i mean
i feel your style is losing its rhythm
 but i really have nothing to think about  you have no right to talk about me
nigel said he would cut back after the second book
 because it's normal    it's not like that
if you are a lying fool
like nigel basiljones  
 how many names does one man need    nigel's parents
this was done for a while
like many debates that adults do
they started reading unrelated things
for the debate they are actually having
brussels is the capital of belgium
capitals change b it will change again
kaito japan 1869 where are those lorries going  
tokyo
usually these debates last for weeks
until they feel it in their hearts
but this is a story book so let's get straight to the point
i'm finally having some success and i want to keep it
if you can support me and follow me right  
you are right
i shouldn't have done that but this is not you b
your drawings tell a beautiful story about haro and our house
i draw our family
it will be the best selling story in our family
nigel knows what he's doing
i like the new you
i can do anything you want you won't eat me
actually today is my cheat day
help where are these guys    
the biggest market heist in history is about to begin
and the first one
but peter always tries
for better or worse
this little pig is going to the market
get a scented soap i was told that there is a perfume shop here
peter shall we have a word  
 are you sure about this    yes
i have never worked so confidently in my life
believe i will never trouble you
again i promise
ok i can't promise we're robbing here are you coming or not  
now is the time
 you all know what you're doing  yes
we steal taylor's sausages and shoot sara nakamoto
what not
we all knock down the farmers and take dry fruits
can be put in taylor's car
 okay  just wait
i feel like a rat
i like that
♪ london bridge is falling down falling down falling down ♪
♪ london bridge ♪
one of these  
i know aren't these beautiful  
give two pounds
thank you
let's do this son for your father
 have a nice day  bye
magic beans
i'm living
stop he is not a farmer
really   but they are dressed like that
that's fashion cultural encounter
get bored
here is a farmer
how are you sir
right here have fun
 take it here  thanks a lot
what did peter say  
the rabbit is coming out of the hole
going around the tree
going back to the hill
william
peter  
come on
straight to the zoo
let's join those strange animals that don't talk
let's go
we will stay here and do the work
here's the chance
 okay closing time  ok
 what's going on then    where are the guys  
wait
 do not  hey benjamin  
what   what's going on
let them go what are they doing  
don't let yourself get caught son
if you do our share will increase anyway
peter
wait peter
come on let's go
no no no stop
wait
you got us
we didn't pick you up if you understand me
great girl
did you really think we would share these with the crowd  
we just wanted people
a good stupid country crowd will follow you everywhere
is this still part of the plan  
did peter do this  
he's not here is he  
maybe he is a bad person
dad is your best friend
my best friend is the raisin fairy
just kidding it's hard to recognize him
near he is russian
you don't know my father
you cannot die in a village farm
like him
why did you do this
no one will adopt me i am old now
always abandoned me
every child in the town was looking for a young rabbit like the one in the book
so i found you
i was just about to bait you when i made a small exchange
but i saw how talented you are
i thought we could do something great
you lied to me
it is easy to lie to someone who is waiting to be trusted
but one thing is true
we are a good team
that is why you are in this car and the others are in cages
this is where you belong peter
we are your family now
not
my family is in trouble it was my mistake
do not
peter
where are the others
what did you do
hey i need the addresses of those who took those animals
we like to say adopted
that information is confidential it is forbidden by law to give it to you
let's go peter
ok here there is
almond milk cashew cheese walnut butter this is a wrong list
he seems to like to eat bones
this is all i have
manchester london the alps are everywhere
did you see what was done   you never learn
because you never gave me a chance you say how bad i am
so stop giving me reasons
ah are you talking  
no yes may be
it could be your imagination i don't know the radio either
this bbc 7 music program talks about songs
especially not peter because rabbits can't talk
here the fuel is running out
i'm not the best
but i can do anything with you
no matter what i do you think badly
you let your whole family go peter
if that's not the worst what is  
 why are you helping me    i do not know
i just saw you and others in trouble so i came
there is nothing to choose
i don't think i'm really pushing this
i'm sorry about your tomatoes it's not a deliberate thing
so what happened  
i found someone who wouldn't tell me everything i do is wrong
someone who wants to accept me
but that's a lie
he used me i'm a big fool
you are not stupid
you are young
so make mistakes
very wrong
i'm not really good at it
i know i've been hard on you
i also lost my father when i was young so i don't know how to be a father
to me  
yes to you
to others too
that's why i'm here
that's what a father does
 i never thought i would have a father  i even knew i was a father
you're not a bad person peter
 i shouldn't have told the others  i couldn't believe it
i know now no one can tell who i am
i think we both have someone we love and want to know that
what i am talking about it must be your imagination
and now you have to imagine that your car is going back down
not
stop the car please stop the car
do not do not
ah
do not
do not do not
no no no
do not
what do you think b  
isn't it great
this is just an idea
this group has brought a story suitable for a movie
they are not really like my rabbits in appearance and behavior
we can't be more surprised b
your last changes brought us to the end
 yes yes  pretty much
but i think a few pages are missing here
the end of this is hao tekak bibi apologizing to each other
ah that's right they are like that they learn from mistakes
i think what we're trying to say here is that the ending is very important
that's all readers remember
ok how one of them has gone to the village
getting a birthday present  
 then kidnapped  ok
they kidnap them all
a rescue mission can be set up using beautiful places all over the country
even outside the country
you can chase with different types of vehicles
just like a race car
 boats motorcycles airplanes  they can jump with it
then they can defeat bad underworld gangs as a team
then they go towards the sunset
but the sky is pink
because that is the color of hope and the future
now if the ending is as thrilling as we've all agreed it's…
i don't know if we all agree
b
sorry to interrupt
thomas
 nice to see you too  nigel
you brought peter too great
now we can show everyone how peter is in zero gravity
mopsy logtails let's go back to our plane
nigel stop
 what    my goodness
come here are you ok honey
 b took the other rabbit  what  
pig duck hedgehog and badger  
 yes i need your car to pick them up  my god
how did this happen   what did i do  
you wrote 80% of the best selling story
get more rabbits
you can buy a million more rabbits with the money you are trying to find
not i'm very sorry but i can't do this
 this is not my world  not in your world  
look around
you made these
this is your world
in my world there are no boats no skiing
also rabbits never jump out of airplanes
b
what are you doing
do you know how much i spent on this   how much did you do
 i think  don't look into his eyes
i want to go to my family nigel bye
your books have no journey without me
this is the last thing we hear about peter rabbit
i will take care of it
come on peter
bye nigel
we are making a big mistake
 what should we do  thomas
ok what do we do about winnie the pooh  
 okay where is the first one    440 gangabada road
 did you speak    let's say it's the radio
these bbc 7 hit songs are ours
so they went to gather the rest of the family
 here it is  the first one was easy
 okay the second one  here we go
the next one is a little harder
but then it became more difficult
hello there has been a slight error regarding the ownership of this rabbit
i promised the lady and a stew
so they went on a rescue mission
as b said before in a way that has never happened in his world
benjamin i'm sorry this is it i never had…
not now peter take me out
ok
this is the rabbit in that book
benjamin i'm really sorry
 not yet  ok ok
do not
we are too late we
 felix is ​​missing  get up
come on let's go soon
 let's go let's go  hey
red light
thank god
but can you come back in 25 minutes   this makes my skin beautiful
hey
that's my pig
that's why i was on the board
lavatori   is this what it means  
where people read newspapers  
yes you don't need to change your name
there is no one in this world who can get along with you
same for me
after everyone is together
they went back to the last rescue
peter knew this was the most dangerous thing
i thought about you enough son
all this time i thought i was manipulating you
looks like you've outsmarted me too
where are the others  
this goes to the same place
with us
 do you know who you work with    yes
i got with the person who tried to trouble my family
but it's not your fault my mistake
i told them that
i believe that i am like this
now i know it
you know nothing child
ah no you taught me a few things
really   what is it like
once a week taylor goes to the market to get sausages
it's a true love story and so  
the second one is
the rabbit comes out of the hole
going around the tree
going back into the den
what
that child that baby
i will catch him when this stops
fools do you know where this stops  
yes in the market entry point
right next to the fence
this reminds me of the day i was put in a cage for the first time
in a city circus i always
whiskers think
about what about being caught   or about the punishment we receive  
anyway they only hire bats so i made a costume
here there is
you are right i just wanted to help you
i think i couldn't imagine you because of this book
i wonder if i will be away from the family i wanted do you know
 i'm very sorry  no i'm sorry
i ran after something for no reason
i forgot important things
our family
i learned that families can come in all shapes and sizes
nigel asked me to put those words in my book
are you kidding
i mean feelings are good but boring
 right    bored  
that's why i said it to make you laugh
 nigel pity him would you like some tea  great
benjamin is the time right now  
my often interrupted heartfelt apology  
i'm very sorry
i just wanted to keep you out of this
i was constantly tormented by what everyone was thinking
who i really am like your brother
your brotherinlaw who doesn't always listen but really promises
i'm very sorry
what
just kidding
but really peter from now on you should think better
and take advice from those who love you
i'm very sorry what

therohite boy
hey

ok let's do it again
ok here we are
hey
 come on  what are you doing  
snipes there were a few more
give a warning  
do i have to pay a penny for it  
are you sure of this  
easy job that's how i first learned to walk
my father walked around the entire fort showing a carrot
just wait
hey what is this
therohite boy
wow
ah
waiting it's not good
oh no
gone like the wind carrot
therohite boy
let's go a little early
no that's not what i meant
wow wow
be careful be careful
wow
wow you are doing great
how can you stop  
he needs help come on
he looks like he's having fun
crazy but fun
he was told that's not going to happen and then there was the law
 hmmmm  i said tapping my leg
daughters dangerous
you gain their trust little by little
two steps forward fifty steps back
none of those steps will go to your fort
she is his mother's daughter
i will look after him and those guests
something about hendrix sounds familiar to me
 hey  snipes
you know the wild horse that was brought to the fort  
yes and so  
suddenly a big wind came and the gate opened
i have nothing to do with it
then lucky got on the horse and they ran towards the mountain
 what    not a good thing
 let's go girl  come on boom
let's go let's go
wow
catch it let's turn back
wow wow
 good thing his name is lucky  is his middle name anumpada  
lucky sit up straight and tighten your legs
or hold tight
don't look down at all
too late
not go a little early
spirit stop
ok
you will be given lots of carrots later
 hi  come on
 let's hold hands  what are you doing  
count to two and hold hands
 one  two
jump
wow
i rode a horse
i almost died but i rode a horse
here we say that the mouth is alive
hey but it's a start you are born talented
 there they are  lucky lucky lucky are you ok
 fingers legs face  did you see it  
 everything is fine you are fine i am fine  that's great we're going fast
 he's fine  i see it
 it was scary but great  everything is fine now
lucky you're lucky not to die
i was thinking of riding him inside the fort
you shouldn't have even gone near that horse
oh annoying
 i only asked for one thing one  it's an accident
 you don't ask  but
you don't ask that horse does not belong to you
those brawlers don't belong to him either
they're wrong but you don't care
this is not in the city we have different rules here
ok you change those rules
besides you can't come into my life whenever you want and tell me what i'm doing
you go back to your grandfather's house you be careful there
 what   that is unfair  i will send you both on the next train
i thought the prescotts wouldn't give up
but you're leaving me again
i'm trying to keep you safe
sorry for the trouble
good thing nothing caught fire
maybe dad sent the wrong lucky to you
not he's right
i couldn't even take care of his mother how can i take care of him  
what happened to milagro was an accident
you yourself have said that he has done that part hundreds of times
even with his eyes closed
 ah  but he doesn't care
ok an apple does not fall far from the tree
he is not careful here
maybe you have to take a risk jim
i already bought it but it didn't work
jim i did everything i could for lucky
he needs his father more than anything
he wants you
if something happens to him i will not be able to bear it
cora i don't understand what i'm doing
wow
oh
wow
spirit
oh
hey boy
i knew we would meet again
hey
wow your family
do not be afraid no problem
i think it was brought about
here
oh
you have the right one
do not be shy
hello baby
what's wrong
alright guys round them up
 i said we will meet them all  let them be
 you catch araka  come on boy
ok
do not
 everyone everyone  okay boss
the big one is for me
spirit
looking left i mean right side
quickly come on let's load them
 ok  good luck now
go climb in
you can't do this
there is no first class in this train
ok i will catch you
stop these horses are not yours
this is not your job
but thank you so much for taking me to them
beware of the horse
hendrix if you want to catch the boat let's go now
change of plan boy let's leave this crazy one
get away from me
quickly let's go
spirit wait spirit
spirit
we cannot do this alone
okay guys
let's go and ask for help
prue i need your help
then you want to catch a fast train with our horses all night
catch some ugly old thieves and save the wild horses  
yes may be
lucky this is crazy
but if we don't try spirit's gang will be lost forever
you don't know what they do to horses  
work them to death
ok i'll show you why it can't be done
hendrix and his crew are trying to catch the boat here in the harbor
by fast train we are here with the horses
this is too far
if we take a short cut here through the middle of this high mountain  
at this height is mount hek
horses cannot cross it
it's a whole day and another night journey
even if by some miracle we join
how do we get the horses out of a train  
if a train travels at 25 miles per hour it stops once every hundred miles
aunt cora is right i need to know these
what now
you have to fill up with water on the way to the train
if we cross the hill we can get to the water tank before the train
tomorrow at noon
 wow what is the dam of regret    you don't need to know that
as i have heard
there are many dangers in that part
accidents that can only be avoided by good fortune
from what
i have heard stories
many dangerous and unforgiving animals lurk in the shadows
animals you won't believe
there's an ox he's waiting
but he doesn't know why
how is he
also there is a changing fox at the foot of the bridge
sitting there and watching
there is still a dead man there
holding a match to burn
wow
abigail don't come near the map
i think abigail is trying to say that this is very dangerous
if you guys don't help me i'll find a way with spirit
you know you're right
we can never save those poor people
innocent beautiful horses
i feel like breaking the rules
ah
 hey lucky wait  lucky  
 lucky wait for us  you have changed your mind
not i still think this is a stupid idea
but
but
this is miradero
here we are together
thank you friend
you can thank us when we get over that mountain
mount heck
we better hurry otherwise we won't be able to get to the water tank by noon tomorrow
 hi boys  okay
legs down and shoulders straight
keep your eyes on where he wants to go
ok but this
 you have to take responsibility for the hurt  i know
wait spirit be careful
be careful
if you believe in yourself the horse will too
he knows exactly what you're thinking and then you're together

the birthday party is over
or accidentally locking the math teacher in the closet
he couldn't come out
i was also in big trouble
does he read that much about me  
sometimes my dad says he needs to go to the bathroom
stop reading about your father
did you see
i said that an elephant is waiting
here there is let's go over the bridge
then straight across the hill to the water tank
does this happen so often  
that's okay
suspension bridges are built to withstand heavy loads
come on
what now
now i decide whether to fall off a mountain and die
or go home and wonder if your father will beat you to death for doing this
do you give up on this  
sorry lucky we tried really
but we have nothing to do
not just wait let's find another way
 take your time  what  
 what    i'll be here with boomerang
 what   how is he  what  
can't the great prue granger even make a small splash

i wonder if this is a good idea
lucky wait
ok i think we do this
ok don't look down don't pull trust him
lucky

 doctor  there is good news
now i know
a welldeveloped medicine in inferman is called spero
submitted to the approval of the medicines board
that's great news ray
did you do this  
 are you    what  
is this your birthday wish  
i love you let's tell mom
translated and subtitled by nilusha hemal alahakon
a subtitling in the zoomlk subtitles section
we should have been given a new medicine
do you know when it will be given  
i you have to talk to dr woo
dad what's going on  
who was the doctor  
doctor who
 hi ray  what's going on  
you said you were giving sparrow to amanda
i'm very sorry
amanda is on my patient list
the company that makes that medicine
remove it
what are you saying
bioprime makes informam
they paid the spero makers to be late
 late    for how long  
can't say
ray
you told me my wife would be fine
i have the same news to share with three other patients
two are children
i'm very sorry
i'm very sorry
welcome
to the assembled audience i'm the bioprime director simon keely
and pennsylvania assemblywoman diana morgan
congressman morgan why are you here today  
i have always been strongly against the drug mafia
and against largescale producers like bioprime
excuse me members of the general assembly
bioprime is like any other pharmaceutical company in the world
our scientists have made
the best treatments to fight cancer
especially inferman a medicine that can increase life span
86% of patients
mr keeley the issue here is not the effectiveness of the drug
the problem is business tactics it's your company's strategy
i believe we all have human rights
to safe and affordable medicine
yes what we are talking about is health care as a human right
our medicines are developed based on research and science
that investment is not only risky but also very big
ok we get a lot of phone calls
can you elaborate   because i don't understand this
i can't imagine that one tablet costs so much
that is a difficult question
don't be fooled by these talking points
politicians in washington
mr keely according to your own reports
the cost for the entire course of treatment is $4
you are exactly right the entire series of treatments is $4
but you forgot to mention the billions of dollars we spent
 your name    ray cooper
 discounts insurance wholesale
i came here because of biopics
as a company trying to heal the world
if you look closely that's what we do with computers
 that's not what you're doing  okay
a little interruption let's go to a call from pittsburgh
ray do you have anything to say to mr keeley  
my wife died in the hospital because you took spero off the market
removing drugs by paying similar drug manufacturers  
that's rude mr keeley
this is
ray
is this shall i say  
i want to speak to ray directly
listen
first of all i'm sorry about your situation
for what happened to your wife
but trust me
bioprime is made to save lives
save lives   you go after the profits of the market
we have already mortgaged our house
i took every penny i could get
you took everything from me
ray the real sadness is cancer
it means almost death
ah
in short what can we offer  
how much
spending to make our loved ones live a moment longer  
a year a month a day  
hmmm hard to put a value on that
if my wife dies
that's your death sentence
i will find you and kill you with my own hands
father

 hello    ray cooper
my name is martin bennett i am a journalist at vice magazine
i am writing an article about bioprime i saw your call on tv
what do you want
i can give you justice for what happened to your wife
can't you can't i have thought about it
i have evidence there has been a crime
a crime that can send many responsible officials to jail
 keely    who is that  
especially keeley we need to meet and talk
 you speak now  not by phone
twenty minutes to meet me at gateway station will not waste your time
who is that
i will come soon

then take the red line to alegani station right

 bennett    yes martin
sorry for the train transfer made for safety
ok sincerely
i am afraid of the depth this is going to
what does that mean  
i received the information bioprime paid for it
about multinational companies
vengeance subterfuge who knows what else all this is the work of simon kiely
others are involved in this in government and higher positions
but recently the relationship broke down
you said there was evidence
about paying kelly to remove spero from the market
but without my information i can't fill in the gaps
you are wasting my time
i have enough things to get people excited about bioprime
but i don't have enough to catch them
that's why i want you your story
 i  i'll think about it
here a family is destroyed by a largescale drug mafia
you help me ray
family human rights those are the main headings
we can spread this everywhere
we can bring down bioprime and bring simon kiely to his knees
hey
father

shah died

my contract is to kill everyone who bothers my client
who else are you chasing  
only the person sitting next to me
can i get you something honey  
do not
i know you are struggling
that's how it is
the village where i grew up
we are farmers
i worked on the farm with my father
one day a group of revolutionaries came
they killed my whole village everyone whole family friends
i managed to hide
now do you understand that i am a child  
so much pain so much revenge
over the years i've killed one
 then you understand  i understand
one thing i learned from it is
there is always an opposing force
no revenge can change that
now in this
you are my village
i am the opposing force
ok there are three ways to solve this
one i tell these policemen who we are
then the situation will be very confusing for both of us
two
i'm walking out that door
hiding all his life so that no one can find him
then what we both want will not happen
three
you say who pays you
we both know i'm going after them
when i do that
you can catch me one more time
that way
at least one person gets what they want
not
you killed a few people but
those deaths are still in your eyes
you are an artist in my world
i didn't mean to kill anyone
not like you
you are not innocent
you knew it was dangerous to go after the powerful
you jumped
i made it to close the road
diana morgan
the one you're looking for
senator

rachel

rothman you have children
this is rachel cooper's opinion
doesn't it bother you to be dragged into all this

i think about him

how can a child live with everything he has seen  
i feel like
looks like he needs to be taken care of
 do the job properly  a memo arrived

you are responsible for martin bennett's murder
you killed my father
now tell the truth

 my goodness  what  
seeing rachel cooper
at diana morgan's rally yesterday evening
what did he do there  
diana morgan's assassination attempt last night
thank you
 the suspect is still at large
pittsburgh police are asking for anyone with information
please call the police
first kelly then shah now a senator  
it's a wonderful thing
rachel obviously knows something
let's look at diana morgan's contributions
look at this what rachel cooper sent us
i took revenge ordered to kill
whoever has the most money wins
that's how it happens
 information about the assassination attempt
the fbi is reportedly arresting the senator
his connections
because the top executives of bioprime company
with simon kiely and vinod shah
and because of the deaths of martin bennett and ray cooper which went unsolved for two years
neither bioprime nor the police will issue a statement in this regard
regarding martin bennett's death
and the death of rachel cooper's father almost two years ago
the past is like a dream
a series of images and emotions
we show some facts about how we got here
although more details are blurred over time
parents and children
where did we leave off
 they will start there

in your hand is my 18th bouquet
my first love that no one knows
i never thought i would cry because of a girl
the girl from yesterday
when i was young everything was different
or i'm more awesome now
that's why i dreamed of a beautiful future
with envy and hope
i remember the day we moved into a new house
i was seven or eight years old at that time
i ran for fun
my devil sister was not born then
the house seemed bigger without him
i was playing alone when i saw a girl
he played in the sand next door

hello wyatt ann
shall i drink your honey  
stupid fool what are you doing  
going to the chair now
just warmed up
stupid fool
stupid fool
stupid fool
 thovu  yes ma'am
last year you were the only one who didn't pass all subjects
you are the last
i hope you will put your mind to work this year as well
without daydreaming
do not reduce the total marks of our class
ma'am
i promise i will study well
going up
 viet ann go and sit near hong hoa  good
how do you get symptoms  
we are assistants right  
forget it
hey
hey wyatt ann
leaving
don't talk to stupid tovu
he is a bad student
that skinny hi
he got the most marks earlier
even our class teacher chiu min is not close to him
but after becoming friends with towu the symptoms subsided
is that true
 i don't know  he said i was stupid
he's right
before viet ann came chiu min was the prettiest
our classmates fought for him
because one of us went after him
hey boy
although she is an orphan she is a good student
he is good and beautiful
but now
viet ann is the prettiest girl in the class
wyatt ann
he knows that
that's why we didn't count what we were doing
the things boys do to get her attention she didn't count
that's why it was difficult to become his friend
think
wow our teacher is beautiful
this year no one can miss this class
you know you don't like my class
to study well you need to be healthy
got it
 yes sir  yes sir
you want to be healthy too right  
so i brought a cup of coffee
take this
sorry for the trouble
thank you
don't think
don't make noise
nothing was right for viet ann like giving flowers standing out
his behavior is very painful
the thing is if they don't count us out we like it more
this is a hassle
according to alexander pushkin love is sacred
and an unimaginably human feeling
it is full of mystery hypnosis magic passion lust
we cannot explain
i love everything by wyatt ann
always thinking about him
his eyes
his smile
his hair
even his name is familiar
like i was friends with him in my past
who can read the next part  
hi
pushkin writes
the longforgotten name
in new freaks
does nothing to our soul
a beautiful past memory
wyatt ann
wyatt ann
wyatt ann
wyatt ann
i barely had the chance to talk to him
time passed like water flowing
i am like a single leaf floating in the water
sometimes watching viet ann makes me sad
mom dad i'm leaving
let's go
are you mad   why wear a jacket in this heat  
i have a plan to call viet ann
you haven't spoken to him in a month
necessity is the mother of creation

you are as stupid as a donkey
dude do you want to die
am i wrong you spend a lot of money
ask god if the girls will get back the money they spent
you know nothing maybe he likes me
because of what

i guess
there is no room for speculation in love
he's right you can't guess in love
talk from a scientific basis
but how  
write a letter

if he reads it to the whole school i'm done
the truth i wrote a letter to your sister one day

i will never forget it
there experience
you are all stupid
who said to write an essay  
take this
wyatt ann love or not not in love yet close to love

he chooses the answer
man love is not a multiple choice question
why not   if you prefer to be brief write two sentences
viet ann loves thovu no love
put a box under them ok

 viet ann  why  
is the movie bitter love beautiful  
i thought you saw it
this is it everyone's opinion is different
i think it's good but i don't like the ending
why  
the two main characters fall in love with each other
but they don't get along
that kind of love is better than not having it
how do you think about love  
i am   love means being together forever
it sounds like you love someone that much

why not viet ann  
not well
love sickness
the common cold
are you going to visit
shall i come too  
wyatt ann
someone brought you oranges
don't get up stay still
shall i wake up  
do you have someone to take notes  
not yet
when i come back i will pick up someone's book
may be
i can help
ok
if you have time
if he doesn't have special feelings for you
he won't let you help him
because girls don't let everyone write in their books
hemingway is a different kind of writer
the meaning of what he wrote is often not what is seen
like his short story mountains like white elephants
at first it looks like that
like a conversation between two people
but if you think about it deeply
we understand
it is a very important decision for the two main characters
like his iceberg theory
we only see a small part of the information
 so let's read  where is your book  
 let's understand the beauty of his work  why don't you write notes  
i write notes to viet ann
so i thought write only his two jobs are useless
are you crazy what if you talk to a teacher exam  
i have been taken several times so there will be no problem
also it is not surprising that some of my lessons are missing notes
teacher
whoa
yes ma'am
why don't you write notes   this is not yours where is the book
i am writing notes
where are the previous notes  
the ones before that  
why don't you take notes in class  
i ran out of paint
then you don't have ink to write your next notes
but there is ink to draw absurd pictures
what is this
my love is like water off a duck's back
why are you smiling
you look like a kid
hold my hand cars are coming
mother let go of my hand
i can go alone
look at tu lee he goes alone
whoa
too bad look at him
that's right do not be afraid
bye teacher
bye
stay well in your class
listen to the teacher
do not talk or fight in class
mom i understand go home
 you know here help him  okay ma'am
my love
i am going home bye
are you the boss now  
i'm not
mother told me to take care of me
he asked me not to take care of you but to help you
how can you help  
i don't know
i know
he told me to write notes when i was bored
that's how you can help
he didn't say that
she is my mother not yours how do you know so well  
let's ask again in the evening
it doesn't matter do not ask
you can't share it
what if you run out of paint  
i don't know
tomorrow we will fill some water
tu lee let's go to school
wait till i come
i added some water
you are stupid
i meant to put some
now i can't even see the paint
i don't know that
come on
tu lee what happened
nothing
where did this paint come from  
 from where    i am
dropped by mistake
why haven't you written anything  
tu lee
my ink is very runny
tu lee
go to kerala
soon
let others work
tu lee these are for you
ok girls don't play ball
you are stupid
i didn't let you play
you can put these in a glass jar
pour water over it put it on me
ok thank you
it is very beautiful
this jar is good
but a little too big
when i win more i'll bring you more until this is full
do you promise  
yes
very beautiful
i will never write you notes again
who was called a duck  
not to anyone that's a beautiful sentence
you always write nonsense in books
don't you remember what was written in a book last time  
do you work in the evening
why
watch a movie
with whom
with me
really  
it doesn't matter if you work
no i don't care
 no work  come at 5 pm
 to the city cinema  okay
bitter love final vision
hey
wyatt ann
nice bike
thaw
 wyatt ann  has it been a long time  
no just arrived
i told you to come here at five
i arrived around 4:30
can i get tickets  
in the front seats right  
three tickets
why three  
why do you boo when watching movies with girls  
i'm a little tired waiting in line to buy tickets
tired   eat guava ok
wyatt ann
stay here with me
as long as i am the principal of this school
there is no relationship between a teacher and a child
go home and make up your mind
hey
why do you fall asleep while watching movies with your friends  
aren't you ashamed  
a good movie
it doesn't matter
that's fine why is it useless  
because
why  
because three people left
three is good
if you think so
i won't talk next time
 okay  not i mean it's more fun if two people watch it
ok two is fine next time go with hong hoa
ok wyatt ann said you would call me
hey shall we go for a sweet soup  
 okay  you guys go work for me
what work
i have to meet someone
is it a girl  
thaw
bitter love
did you bring me the balls
not i want them back
why is that  
why what
i lost mine
i want these for revenge
i don't give them
what if you lose this too  
no time
give them to me
give it back
give me back my jar
in the jar here you can get it
here are the flowers
beautiful
do not cry
tomorrow i'll give you double the balls
give me these back
otherwise i will never talk to you again
what about me
one ball to protect here
i wrote you notes yesterday you owe me two balls
 okay  tomorrow i have to pay
let's go
hey
 what    can you give me some paint  
can't
only if you paint
but not near me now
will you bring it tomorrow  
will bring
can't forget
 not at all  keep promises right  
thaw you told me not to come
but hong hoa came there
nonsense
are you mad  
if hong hoa comes everywhere like the second wheel
even my grandfather can't do anything
the problem is with viet ann
if he didn't ask to come hong hoa wouldn't have come
so
what am i doing
go ahead
how  
stay away for a while
it's going backwards
you don't understand
there is a philosophy that only intellectuals can understand
i don't understand that
dude
girls are a wonderful race
there is a french saying
follows love love flees flees love love follows
but did not understand
that means
if you follow love it will go if you let it go it will follow
try to stay away from him for a while
are you telling me to move to another city  
you idiot
or to go to another school  
not you don't even have to stay at home
so what
don't count
show a cold face
very cold
 thovu  what  
let me play this game
what  
today viet ann looked at you twice
that's a good start keep doing
 cold    yes
 how cold is it    as much as possible
ok
do not laugh
cold as ice
ok
 enough now i'm tired  me too
you walk without reckoning
i follow at a distance
like saying in the middle of the poem without thinking
we are like a duet
thank you
as you say
does wyatt ann like me or not  
what about the french saying
follow love love follow her follow her follow her
i missed him for a week but so is he
because of this my money is saved
hey kid i'm still talking
are you upset
do i look happy  
so you think viet ann is happy with your sudden change  
what do you do  
i wanted to give you a good book
did you read
not yet
how do you know a book is good  
this is
what book
here
one hundred days is written by amitov
how many centuries have you not spoken to me  
not
it was because i was too busy
the liar
that's true
i looked like a frenchman
looked like a frenchman  
yes french people are always busy
you idiot
make it look like work you are crazy
where is my ink
not near me
why  
i don't want to mess with you
but you took it yesterday
took a little
still took it
if you know you're such a liar you won't give a shit
the liar
you don't care
when you see his face you can see that he is a scoundrel
pay me for my paint
no time
are you trying to trick me  
and so  
let's start
let's go  calm down
don't fight i will give you paint
don't give him anything
let's see what can be done get out of my way
you are
are you ok  
oh it's bleeding head injured will i be in trouble  
hello madam
go to your chair
five stitches is hard isn't it  
it hurt a little because i was numbed but the stain will be there
a stain  
does that make you ugly  
can be covered with my long hair isn't it  
may be
hey
if your mother asks don't say i'm involved
i don't say i'll say fell
alone  
alone no one pushed
if you tell my mother she will tell my mother and tease me
i know i won't say a word about you
but don't talk to me i have been very sad for the past few days
me too when you're gone something feels missing
when a girl plays with a boy children meet
stupid boy
thaw
yes ma'am
how did tu leyi get injured  
his head hit the table
why did you say two bloods  
hit the wall  
this is
i don't know the truth
that's what my classmates told me
maybe on the wall
there are many walls in our school
where are you  
he's in the room still fever
you can go and see
two bloods are you ok now
why are you sitting here  
a little better
here is your notebook
 you drew new pictures  yes
this is not the whole book
but i have an idea about the ending
to our blue haired princess and messy haired prince
wow your pictures are beautiful
this is for you
wow
secret notebook
the blue haired princess only loves the messy haired prince
the prince grows up and becomes a foolish prince
 how is that    why not  
as he grows older he becomes more and more stupid
stupid ass why did you go to viet ann's house  
the work was done
if i walk away he will walk away from me
girls are like that
they never know what we do
but we know what not to do
ok
this has to stop
what are you saying
this unknown feeling
the one who loves is the last
i didn't understand
that means
you need to get out of here
how  
in a letter
he usually leaves here
right  
you say
i'll be here until he arrives
the letter is given to him
ok
hi
but that's it
hurry up
why worry do not give the letter at once
you have to give that letter with emotion
i believe
he is impressed by this
if you give the letter with a few tears
believe
a man's tears are a girl's weakness
he's right
 lottery tickets  what is this  
lottery tickets

this letter is from miss hong

all this is because of you
nonsense

your guess   why always guess  
but i don't understand
 albert camus says  nonsense
you and your albert
have you ever really loved someone other than the scene  
i love a billion people
if you were me
what are you doing take her love  
in this case
how do i know  
those billion people did not love me
what the hell
then you don't know anything about love
you are a very stupid consultant
you only know what others have said
 how are you then    how am i  
after viet ann comes along all you do is read about her
and you  
you tested me
 did you help me    are you saying no  
who did you go to when you needed money  
 if not for the chess set  i'm tired of your love
did you really give the letter to viet ann  
you say
did i lie  
who knows
you're jealous because wyatt ann likes me
you pretended to give the letter
but really didn't give
you didn't just break my heart
also bought the chess set
two birds with one stone
you keep reading put me out
now go from here
you are a bad friend
scold you
why are you crying
in a few days
i leave

when i die
i was waiting for a parade full of royalty and family
but no one came
in my last breath i cursed everyone who forgot me
when i came to the gate of heaven
i was waiting for someone to receive me
i order this open

not as a gift
as a punishment
i was imprisoned and sent to earth
serve ten masters and understand the reality of life
to be honest

deepu's birthday  
 your wife  how do we know  
darling today sorry a customer came
today is january 12 why  
so what were we going to do on january 12  
january 12  
i am ovulating (ovulation)
i made a calendar and put it in your cupboard
it clearly has:
we should try to have a baby by january 12
darling i have a lot of work to do here there are a lot of deliveries
 prepare the invoice  ok sir
you tell your customers to give you a baby
you get that delivery from them
listen carefully varun
if you want your child's face to look like yours come for half an hour
what does it mean   given
what did the sisterinlaw say  
his voice is overacting
 did you bring your helicopter    yes outside
see you later bye
where are the rest of the clothes  
the crow is heavy
did you come drunk  
smoked cigarettes
friends insisted so drank a root beer
varun you lied to me and drank with your friends
you also know that we are going to delhi tomorrow
today is such an important day for us
how can you work without responsibility  
do i have to say it again and again   what drinking and smoking do to sperm
drank one glass
if one glass weakens the sperm then the medicine
it's not about sperm it's about your promise
what do you think i don't want to drink with friends  
but i know what's important show some maturity
you talk so maturely
what did the doctor say   be careful of your sleep
who watched baby's day out until 3 last night   am i
you are very mature
richa said that looking at cute babies makes her mood better
it is good for the health of their children
can't even imagine
you are a journalist and he is a lawyer
are you talking about these things  
ok you are alone and look after the cute babies let's see if it will get you pregnant
 do you want a child or not    i want it myself
but you don't want to feel like you're going to a fight when you go to the room
so much pressure
there is no such pressure even when playing video games so how to raise a child  
isn't the hook heavy now  
my hook i'll keep it what about you  
sorry d i feel the need of a child
that's why i take it too much
sorry baby
i'm sorry too
here we go to the battlefield general
going to the moon  
doing this will increase the chance of pregnancy
there is a lot of chance that your mental level will fall
i'm still mad at you
varun how are you going to drink with your friends if you lie to me  
you said sorry a while ago just started again  
i want to say sorry to you
i said that lie because you have been acting
i can't waste my fertile days like that
that means you
did you lie to me and say sorry  
melo is no secret
let's go and have dinner then let's do it again
do it again
 what to do    now that's what we did
don't you feel sorry for me  
my insides are torn apart smoke from here
i can't do it i can't
absolutely not
 varun  i
i laugh
thank you
sorry to force you so much but this is very important
this time there is a very positive feeling i feel
put your legs down please
do not do this yoga it doesn't make sense
why  
i didn't do anything
i just lied
just shouted lies
what
can you fake that too  
it is very difficult
you just have to make up your face a little
this is wrong and unfair given
i can't do this
if i tried harder i would end up with a hernia
what are you doing do you drink water  
what are you doing   given
 where do i sleep    on the couch
oh brother let's go slower our stomachs are turning
let's go loud god
otherwise we will miss the flight
what happened to you
two years ago children said there was no urgency
so you were also busy with work
should i have a purpose   it's fierce
i will say the child my job will also stop so  
can't even imagine
it started early in the morning
no tea no water don't eat breakfast
baby let's do it one more time
if you get pregnant this time i say to the child:
dad said he made you bald
i'm ovulating varun
there is a party at home in the evening so i have no nirvana god
i want to catch the flight mother calls and worries
on top of that they send messages after messages did you just find it today  
ohhh i'm very sorry
i will tell my ovary not to ovulate on family holidays
take it out anytime why bother me  
sir sorry to bother you sir
ovulation happens 14 days before the day of the month sir
females can get pregnant only then

he's at the bar
 how long have you been married    7 years

i said don't take what they say to heart
i came to say this
no kids yet i have an idea
i know a baba

that's not it we asked you to come to talk about something important
i know what you are going to say
we are now trying to have a child
but your brother is trying to help
 don't start where everyone is now  calm down brother we are a family
with whom to tell without us  
the sisterinlaw is telling the truth you have to keep trying
we have done it three times a day ask him about the poses we did:
 missionary spooning doggy  enough
no need for details one by one
i am very worried about this
sometimes i wonder do we really need a child…
or that they are going to have children because society wants them to
if you look at facebook and twitter their children are famous
if you are hit hide
why make us jealous   why show  
but bro when we get old
children see our future
that's what everyone says
why are we talking about an ambani
it's going to be a chinku tinku minku after cleaning their noses our hair grows
then the relatives came and said oh so sweet says
after that he puts kakka in his pants
then they hand the child to us: clean the child and bring it back
after that the ole ole ole is applied again
after that we go with him and feed him and he poops
he feeds he eats
 would you like another beer    i will finish this first
who is dr joshi   why did you text me his number  
best fertility specialist in mumbai

i don't want to see those sex experts bathing
varun what century are you in  
wait a minute sisterinlaw varun do you remember that cherry  
anu aunty's daughter  
she and her husband tried for 5 years
5 years no children
finally they went to mumbai and met dr joshi
what happened after a year  
came back with two healthy children
two kids in 6 months  
oh my god twins
 say so  yes twins
seeing a doctor is nothing to be ashamed of
dr joshi is the best bro
meet once
okay let's go see you

a big help
not happy with anything
why do white children come from tube births

sorry my mistake
thank you miss pusey
i am susie
sorry my mistake
hello
please be seated mr and mrs batra
i looked at your report
tell me this
how is your relationship with your wife  
there will be fights but that's okay
he asks connections
 sex life you ask    yes frequency  
 slavery  twice
how many days  
 for a week  per month
i think you know once a week and
that there is a big difference between twice a month
ok your reports are not that good
your egg count is rapidly decreasing
what does it mean  
it means that something to be done has to be done quickly
but doctor am i all right  
let's just say you still have some good swimmers
 swimmers   ohhh sperm    yes
now listen to this carefully
the quality of your cooks is good
but they faint when they enter his universe
remember   why  
do not be afraid it is very common at that age
now both listen to this
this is what you need to do deepti's eggs and your swimmers
taking it from your bodies and making it bear fruit in our lab
one of the best labs in india
yes
once the embryo is formed we put it back into your body
this process is called in vitro fertilization
ivf
great let's do it
but doctor in this job i have to take a lot of leave from the office don't i  
if you both really want a child
i mean that all the work has been done aside think about pregnancy
but i can go to work right  
 can i go    what  
sure mr batra you can work
good
please take a look at this i'll see you in a minute
what happened to you
what will happen to me   what happened to you  
a strange doctor just taking money
catch a flight and go to god and bring a child for the amount they give us
we are legally bound why are you ashamed to say sex  
contact a man talking to a woman may not be the same
darling let's hook up tonight
shut up
what's that nonsense   16 times a week
where was i the other 14 times  
so i was scared
doctors asking me where it hurts he asks how many times he will be contacted
this is not something i talk about every day
varun don't be an air
 he is a very good doctor  just how very good doctor
please come
come let's go
the lab is 12000 square feet money is minted here
this is where we create lives
wow

who is that doctor  
it's my lady dr joshi
ohh ok
why  
no just
may i ask something doctor  
what if my eggs are not fertile  
then we can use donor eggs
did you say contribution  
donor said take the eggs of a young woman and let them bear fruit with your sperm
after that it can be kept from deepthi's body
you guys are awesome good
parenting two people is an art
or did you think that actors become parents at such an old age
 that the children have been affected by their star quality    the truth
but it's easy for you to buy it isn't it  
why didn't you do that  
everyone has a need to carry their genes forward it's a very deep thing
come on
ask something too create a passion
doctor there is a little problem
i thought birthing methods have improved so much
are there ways to get men pregnant  
definitely

but he was actually a girl before
her ovary and private parts were removed
got it got it that's cool too thank you
the nurse will explain other things to you
we will give you hormone injections for the next cycle
so there may be changes in thoughts

 are you sure    are you sure   i have not done phd in this either
this is the first time this has happened to me
yes his wife is carrying your child
 it's not a baby yet mom  i know
what is varun doing now  
where is your phone
what is the password  
00
0000
a great find
please sleep let me sleep
hola be careful
richa can you say kisar don't say hola to him
 please  ok ok
 what happened    yes varun  
sorry for the late night call
you are hearing the case in mumbai on friday right  
yes
 can you come on thursday    what happened  
come on i'll tell you
take this monster please
i will keep this i will talk to richa and tell her
don't call him a monster
varun please that's my phone
okay sorry
what happened
moni
it is also definitely pregnant
who
 that hifi guy    yes
you should be happy
you will have two children
this is ours too it's ours too
that's right
i'm afraid they will drop the baby
no please where to fall while holding hands
oh no
i thought from his story they will go to the doctor and get rid of the baby
why do that   aren't they afraid of goddesses  
he said that they will not keep a child of my quality
are they crazy  
what do they know about your quality  
what do you think
pack your things moni we cannot let them lose our baby
what the hell
let it go your way
in 9 months she will be the mother of your child
you will be the mother of his man's child
you two gave the name of doctor munna bhai
now i am thinking of suing them
they are going to make teams with my sperm
no case will be filed do you think you are in america  
as much as you get two million dollars in compensation
he is a famous doctor if you find out from the media
a hindi film is being made from this incident
our families know about this everything ends
so what are you thinking  
what do you think   she is thinking of having an abortion
i was going to ask you will it be a legal issue if we do that  
no no they are two people who are married
abortion can be done within 20 weeks of pregnancy with the doctor's permission
if we do that
can that honey sue us  
you can sue but can't win
in pregnancy cases the mother's rights and the father's rights are the most important
your decision is final
but i say that you go to that doctor
he already knows the case not going out much
let's have an abortion
let's have an abortion
are you ok
are we ready for this  
while your husband fills the form we will do the scan come on
bright
see the gray dot on the screen  
that baby's heart it beats
why are you showing me that  
because i know how you longed to be a mother
the final decision is yours
i don't want to pressure you especially not in this case
a very sensitive event
but once you forget everything and think about this heart
about this heart that beats inside you
it's a living thing
what did you do to get here  
getting pregnant is a blessing for any woman
but believe me in your case
this is a miracle
given
before you decide to adopt this baby remember that idiot's face
has the intelligence of a 12yearold child
we keep a child of such a man at home
varun is not that man's child our child
it grows like us
okay if 5% grow up to be like that guy what river are we jumping into  
look i know you're very emotional
rest for three to four days then let's have an abortion
can't
life is growing inside me
i saw that heart beating with both my eyes
do you understand how wrong what we are about to do is  
we went to take this child's life we cannot be murderers
don't act so much
given
given
 they are  who  
his father
ring the bell and go away
 don't talk like a baby  he has come to ask about babbu
deepu and varun's house
did you see this hi fi they use hindi for style
we write paradise they write home
he seems to have done a great thing by writing that he is home
you go inside i will take care
 wait and see  granted they are dangerous
please give
hello sister in law how  
well say
 you want to talk  tell me
right here   let's go inside and talk come moni

thank you
 here  from the bottle itself  
he treats us like family not guests
 what are the details brother    here is the water

brother the story is straightforward
a surprising thing happened to us that bone was transferred
 bones    sperm
that's all we want to know is our child safe  
isn't this your child   our boy
 but the sperm is mine  then his baby's sperm is mine
 how so   the eggs are mine  then the eggs are mine
but the sperm is mine
eggs and sperm are you crazy   what do you want now  
the child that came from my sperm is in my sisterinlaw's womb she needs to be protected
in return i will vouch your person is here he defends himself
we don't care if he is safe or not
we want you two not to bother us
trouble   sister tell brother
let's talk about this what do babies do after birth  
you said you don't want a baby of my quality
so sir we say if you don't want the baby give it to us after you find it
we'll take care of both of us
awesome just wait
 what is this month    march
november in 9 months okay he will meet in november
shut up
 i'll talk to you later  that's right
it would be better if you get up and get rid of it
if you say that shit again getout
why are we being told to go  
she owns this house if he can tell me shutup
can't you say getout  
then get up and go
crazy people
you are also very absurd people
even now there is a bomb in the candy box
 what is that varun    did you mean that  
we are one team showed team work
you want to keep this child in your stomach for 9 months make it suffer pain
give it to them after they give birth  
do you even know how insensitive you are  
insensitive   am i insensitive  
insensitive i am not you
whose decision is not to abort without talking   your
now take care of them
they smell of mustard oil
after today i will not allow your child's father to come to my house
my child's father

both are good biscuits
richa i don't trust that honey at all
it comes later something has to be done
what will you do sisterinlaw  
legally they cannot be stopped from staying in that building
but you can stop calling the child rights
what if we make a deal  
it's obvious that after giving birth
they have no right to our child and we have no right to theirs
no relationship again
regardless of whose spam it is
i will check the law and talk to you
 i need some time  bye

nothing went because of stress do you mind
smoking cigarettes do you smoke marijuana now

my mother made it
 does your mother know    no monita made it
so thought to bring you too

why are you smiling
'flesh'
sorry
there is a beautiful library
if you read hindi books here it is
no no i also read english novels
i did english horrors from gurunayak dev university (honours)

we'll read yours you read ours
give me money
here
read moni here
moni reads moni has done english 'horrors' in english
 horrors good good  thank you
what is this nonsense  
writing this with so many english words means that there is a big cheat in mind
otherwise this could have been written in french
no sisterinlaw how can we sign without understanding  
shutup what is this written  
whether we have a daughter or a son send them to college in canada to teach in english
grow up be an athlete or a rapper
so  
yeah yeah because his father is a fan of milka singh
we are fans of honey singh
what is this joker thing   is this a joke or a song  
joker  
we are cute you read what you say
varun are you saying something  
i was thinking about his future
you don't have to think we are already thinking
 mony tell me who it will be  an athlete or a rapper
shut up folks
want to know what's in this agreement  
this means that you will not even be around after the birth of our child
you can't even have a relationship
we have no right to your child and you have no right to our child either
take the pen
take this pen and sign it
sister we're here to make friends but you want to break up

 i take a selfie  sisterinlaw the 'flush' is on
 varun stop it  sister in law
i read the contract they brought at night
it has told how to raise the child
until the child turns 16
he is told to add local butter to his food because his bones need to be strong
a great character
looking for a great man to exchange sperm
now i can see sardar's face in a dream
who is the sardar behind that  
 it's not funny man  look
sir speaking to that meeting
i will come say you are watching 'kesari'
i don't know what their problem is
what does he want from us  
not one of you brother from the person in the belly of the sisterinlaw
people who say their blood is thicker than water
shut up
don't tell me seeing monica's baby makes you
don't even once think that it is your own child
your biological child
no i don't think so
i'm going to the meeting i will talk later bye
7 months
in the seventh month
but there's no moving doctor
at this point the baby is about to kick
maybe hit but you don't feel it because you are busy
what does this mean doctor  
he has my attention
i think about him even when i work
i will not avoid it for anything
happy
it's good that you are busy and not stressed like other mothers
really
can i see the child's biological father's file  
his medical history is like that
sorry deepti they are confidential
calm down your baby is very healthy
if there is a problem i will tell you
this is because i don't know anything about them
always feeling scared
then try to find out
if you all take this journey together it will be easier for everyone
and you are not the only one who is afraid
monica's fear is no less
really  
her calm complexion looks like she is pregnant every year
hello aunty how are you  
so at the kitty party  
do it just calling
we are coming with your grandson
ok bye
sister in law

you're giving away those dried golgappet aren't you  
since when are you planning to have a child  
 since 6 years  really  
i got pregnant twice before
but she miscarried
but did you try for a child  
are children more important than their own health  
why not adopted  
our blood must be our own
hello brother
sorry a little late
traffic names in your mumbai it's like people build houses out of cars
why did you ask me to come  
brother let's leave everything aside
thank you for coming first
brother we have been here for 7 months now
but i didn't sit down and write a man's speech
so i thought i'd meet outside
get out in two minutes when you get home
you know that the second thing is this
what happened to us is a strange thing
but i am happy that my sperm was exchanged with a good group
my sperm is winning the wrong race but they win anyway
so what do you drink brother   hey little one
two large whiskeys brother soda or water  
it's still 6:30
did you ask for soda or water   or are you hitting raw  
i have a strawberry dachshund a virgin
what dacry  
 let's catch it  okay
no bro i can't say cheers with this dakry
no i can't look at the color
 get one for me  no
 can't say no  no no
please brother
but a small one
yes yes we are worried just bring it
brother
cheers
does your brother think about the child  
don't know
honey  
i think so but he is very worried about you
don't you feel bad  
if you feel like it
 oh my god  what happened  
kicked again he has become quite a mischievous person
come brother please
 brother one kiss  no no
 brother one kiss  are you crazy  
all problems disappear
say something  
that is our doctor joshi
it's not joshi it's doshi
it is doshi himself
he said mr batra take the egg this way the sperm no spam take the spam
then you stay at home we will keep this child growing in the lab
what happened to my brain  
what has happened to science now
mom and dad at home
children are born in the lab as if created by the right hand of the great brahma
95% successful
i heard words from him that i thought were not in this world
what is that 'ovary' when i hear it reminds me of a song
brother there it is called 'morni' not 'overi'
overwhelmed it fits
brother tell me this…
myno did your baby take to kicking like that  
i don't know
you guys are very nice but one thing is nagging at me
don't think anything brother god has done what has to happen
but i am worried that something will happen to my child because of your carelessness
 excuse me    there is nothing to apologize for brother
sisterinlaw is 7 months old now but he won't quit his job yet
where are you going to take so much money  
it's his decision
 don't take it personally  personal  
my sperm is inside your lady your sperm is inside moni's
what could be more personal than this  
what is this nonsense  
are you calling me to say that  
elder brother
i won't lie to you
i am calling you because i am worried about my child
because of your jobs if anything happens to my child
teaching you a good lesson
who are you to teach me lessons  
can you tell me that i danced with you anything like that  
sir please
 sir there are more customers  when the customers die
i haven't started threatening yet
you don't even know if the child started kicking or not so what else  
and you wanted to hand over my child to you and sign the contract
never meet
shouldn't i be bothered when my sperm stops at such careless monkeys  
i should not have come here
i can't even think of a child with your face in my house
did you hear here  
his child's face is like mine
why are you laughing  
your child's face will be like mine
 so    so what  
sir you are annoying other customers
please go or i will call the police
i'm a real batra i don't even move
this batra is leaving here after finishing his drink
here is the real batra call the police if you want
wretched
yaman yaman english puppet getout
whenever you look at it it says getout
hello police  
 baby are you okay    yes i'm fine
met that monica
his baby has been kicked
but he hasn't kicked yet
dr joshi said everything is fine
but now 7 months at this point it's time to kick
kicking kicking
my sperm was exchanged with honey batra not with ronaldo
is that the only problem you have  
you can't breathe for two minutes in this house without hearing the name of the joker family
i have
i'm very sorry
it doesn't matter
mom and dad are coming next week
i want to give you a surprise
very happy
i don't understand how to stop
why stop  
mom and dad i feel happy
don't act like everything is normal
varun can be normal for everything
you have no 1% relationship with this child  
there is no bond
there is no bond hang me
he grows in your stomach for 9 months
you bond with him i can understand that's normal but i have no such obligation
and i don't care if this is given to that joker as soon as it is born
this is the second time you said that but what you said is correct
what will happen to you if you give this child to them  
are getting pregnant and carrying a child a big deal  
just have to worry a little
small problems while bathing hair falls blisters appear wounds appear thousands of injections are given
laughing crying and peeing because the bladder can't handle the baby's weight
fever cold cough
no matter what you can't take medicine because it's not good for the baby
but are they big things  
you can't wear the clothes you like because nothing fits
you can't eat your favorite food because it's not allowed
katapiya bears stress and change of feelings
don't get in the mood of others
a mother devotes her entire body system to these 9 months
varun feels pain while giving birth it's something i can't even imagine
but we bear everything with a smile
because we know
when seeing the child for the first time
that everything has value
but what is the contribution of the man inside during pregnancy  
it's like ahhh baby i'm gone
i am sure you will not understand these
because you were never in this together varun
you were always thinking about how to keep them away from us
how is this good news varun  
since hearing this news nothing good has happened between us
take me to the hospital he didn't come home since evening
his phone is also off
i will die
given
given

once upon a time there was a lazy boy who never wanted to do anything his mother asked him to help with the chores but he wouldn't
his father asked him to do his homework but he wouldn't
one day the boy realized that he wouldn't have any friends if he continued to be lazy
he decided that he would start helping out more and working harder
from that day on the boy worked hard and he was much happier
we believe that this will not only help improve the quality of machine translation but also contribute to preserving the cultural heritage of india
please speak more slowly
that dog is going to be the death of me
who was there
what was there
don't say that you saved my life
